If you are looking for a very relaxing, quiet and serene place, I would recommend Weggis which is about 45 mins ferry ride from Luzern. Costs in Weggis are also lower than Luzern.  Highly recommended and would return.",0,train
"There is very little I can write, by way of giving information, that isn't already widely available across the internet, so I'll stick to personal advice and experience. The ""At The Top"" experience can be booked up to 28 days in advance and I'd strongly recommend doing that. It can avoid hours of queueing on the day. You can also add the option of a virtual reality experience and I'd also recommend that.  The experience begins with a journey to the 125th floor in the fastest elevator I've ever been in, yet you have no real sensation of the speed when inside. It's only when you get there, and look down from the viewing platform, that you realise how far you have travelled in such a short space of time. There is a photographer offering the usual professional shots that you think you'll never buy, but they were so good that we did buy several of them. However, you can also capture many great shots with your own camera, so be sure to remember to take it with you. I'll attach several of my own to this review.",1,train

"It’s a 15-minute ferry ride to this island from the Market Square marina. (I think I paid €3 roundtrip mid-week.) Ferries are frequent, and signage at both ends makes the schedule very clear. It’s a fairly good-sized set of islands connected by bridges with paved or well travelled dirt paths crossing them all. It’s very pleasant to walk around and take photos— I especially liked exploring the old armaments and fortifications.  I didn’t pay to enter the museum, and otherwise didn’t find much to DO there. (There is a small market for food and drinks.)  But if you’re content with some scenic strolling, or finding a perch to take in the atmosphere, then this is a pleasant place to spend a couple hours. If time is limited and you can choose only one, take the ferry to Tallinn instead.",0,train

"a month ago Phenomenal Experience!!! It's not just tallest, it's Gorgeous too. You would not like to go away from this area. The experience you would love from the outside on the ground is far better than to go up to the 125th floor. The building looks a giant beauty from the area where Dubai fountains are!! Go in the evening to have a better experience. Dubai mall is close to the building so you spend a day in shopping then enjoy the evening over here!!!",1,train

I took the ski lift partially up, walked 94 floors up and down and then took the slide the remainder of the way down.  The slide is a BLAST and should be experienced by all.  Like most public places in China, bring toilet tissue with you.",1,train
"This was a bucket list check.  I have wanted to go to the top since it was built.  We went to the 125 floor.  My visit was pre COVID.  I was very disappointed. It was super crowded and the viewing windows were not clean.  The views were incredible, of the night sky, but was difficult to get good pictures through dirty windows.  It was very pricy as well.",0,train

"Getting the ferry over to Suomenlinna was relatively easy.  Tickets are available through the HSL app, or you can get them at the pier. It’s about 15 minutes to the island, from the South Harbour.  The island itself, still has inhabitants, but it’s great to walk through the buildings or among the coast edge - explore the battery ruins, cannons and bunkers as well as old barracks.  I also realised, it’s an amazing location to see breathtaking sunsets over Helsinki.",0,train
"Place that is great, remained here three nights. Website traffic is insane, the street is as a sea of mopeds, it's a leap of faith when crossing the street! They actually ride on the pavements! Though it's an incredible site, every block offers various products, therefore in case you desired a digital camera you will visit the Camera or maybe perhaps electrical street. Restaurants are abundant in which you are able to get a banh mi along with a beer at insane low prices. The Lake is a great place to stroll around and chill out.",0,train

"Located in the ""Western part"" of Strasbourg's ""Grand Isle"" lies this masterpiece of history.  UNESCO has awarded it, in 1988, its ""World Heritage Designation""...  The ambience is reflective of the 16th Century buildings and roadworks construction {made of ""cobblestones""}.  There are ever so many ""fine details"" which will ""excite one's imagination"" as well as contribute substantially to one's memories of the small to Medium sized city.  Strasbourg's ""rich history"" and economic evolution is displayed...  TripAdvisor has also awarded it the coveted ""Certificate of Excellence"".  It is also one of the most highly rated (by travellers like you and I) attractions in Strasbourg.  Definitely worthy of a visit- both to the city as well as this ""historical district"".I hope that this Review has been helpful.",1,train

We were in Helsinki for one day as part of our Baltic Sea cruise and the trip out to this fortress were a few hours well spent.

This being the main square with multiple attractions was jammed with people!  We did not have any issues with pick pockets per se but be aware that people just stop right in front of you to take pics/selfies without consideration for who may be behind them.  There are lots of pigeons and gulls and gulls eat pigeons if given the opportunity.  With that being said there are also numerous places to eat and shop in the arcades around the main square but be wary of paying a premium for the luxury.  You might as well see the sights here as the palace and the basilica are in the same place but I would do my shopping and eating a few streets away.,0,train

The fortress is a group of islands which you can walk between which are covered with gun points, walls, barracks etc on pretty islands. I’d recommend a tour to explain what you are seeing. It takes about three hours to explore. You need trainers or similar as the cobbles are uneven. There are good cafes and restaurants on the islands.",1,train

After having read so much about the 8th Natural wonders of the world - this place is exactly how i imagined. I wish i had some time to hike which would be a great experience.

We did a DIY tour using the free audio download app.  It was perfect for us.  We booked direct on the official website. Then downloaded the app for audio tour. It means you can go around at your own pace but still be informed of the sights and information. If you are going to go to the Colosseum then the Arena is a must. Incredible. We were lucky in that we did not have to mix with crowds due to covid times. We understand you cannot just turn up but must pre book.  Much cheaper to book direct.  We did not have to queue at all either. We chose to do the Forum and Palantine Hill first then the Colosseum - saved the best bit until last.,0,train

My family visited Lake Luzern on Sunday...this place is definitely less busy than Zurich.  We even rented a motor boat out to the Lake for an hour ride.  Totally worth it.  The name of the boat place is SNG.  It's right across from to the train station. $65 for an hour.  There were 5 of us and it's better than renting a paddle boat.  I'd suggest going out with your picnic basket right before sunset so you can enjoy your dinner out by the lake before it gets dark.  The boat rental place closes @8 p.m.There's also Amorino Ice Cream store & eateries as you stroll along Lake Luzern.  I'd it's worth spending a day in Lake Luzern!,0,train

We were short on time -so got the petit tren tour which is ideal. It takes you at a slow pace round La Petite France part of this lovely city. Whatever else - you must see this part. It is a time warp with very narrow streets/canals and half timbered houses from the 15-16 century -all well preserved.The streets are cobbled and the whole area is very picturesque In the Middle Ages it was home to the tanners/millers and fishermen and today is a world heritage site.

"This was my 6th time in Istanbul, and during every of these travels I've visited Hagia Sophia, as I regard it as one of world's most famous and important edifices. This time it was a different experience. Hagia Sophia is an iconic world heritage edifice, built on orders of Emperor Justinian. It still holds the world record being built in only 5 years (532-537). It was the main and biggest Christian Church where many kings were crowned for almost a millennium, until the Ottomans came in 15c converting it into a Mosque. During the times of Ataturk reformations it was established as a museum in 1935 - and it was one of the world's best. My memories root in that period, when you had to queue in a long line outside, paying around 10 Euros entry fee and when you could admire outstanding frescoes and mosaics from 6th c onwards, along with Ottoman decorations added from 15c. It was a unique place in entire world (along with some Churches in Andalusia) where you could admire such a cultural and religious mix. This was until this year, when it was reestablished as a Mosque again in July. While the imposing exterior remained the same, the interior is much different. You cannot walk the multi centuries stone and marble floor, as it's completely covered with a green carpet (you must take off your shoes before entering). All amazing Byzantine frescoes and mosaics are covered in white sheets and you cannot see them, nor you can climb the upper gallery where there're more. Therefore I give 4 stars, otherwise I'd give 100. Now, there's no entry fee, you can walk in freely (except during prayer times), but I wish I still had to pay and see all these now hidden jewels I remember Hagia Sophia for. I enclose pics from my previous visit in 2012 and now, 2020 - catch the differences.",1,train

"This is on the site of ""things one must do in Helsinki"", but other that respecting the historical nostalgia of the Finnish defense of invaders from Sweden and Russia, this held nothing for me except to expand my imagination. The queues for the WCs are almost intolerable, and the stenches from inside the WC are intolerable. The photos of the ""guards and the prisoners"" in the physical labor in making this historical site is also a review of the political history of Finland (as in neighboring Russia) as the ""laborers"" are the defeated Finnish citizens of the ""red party"" and the guards are those of the victorious ""white party"".....Strange how history repeats itself. If one wants a historical understanding of the makings of Helsinki, this location will certainly provide that.",1,train

"Suomenlinna guards the only deep-water access to Helsinki. First the Swedes, then the Russians built fortifications all around several islands. At one point, the main island was home to a Russian merchant community - complete with Orthodox church.  The islands are dotted with bunkers, defensive stone walls (up to 12 meters thick), barracks, powder magazines, dozens of cannons, and even a small shipyard. Plus a museum, several restaurants, and a few shops. An open-air theater operates here in summer, as well.  Main pathways are mostly gravel or stone... so wear comfortable shoes. And, like most of Helsinki, the islands are hilly. There's even a small beach accessible in warmer months.  It's a wonderful place for a hike. But carry a jacket for when the wind picks up. Expect to spend at least half a day exploring.  Bonus: If you buy a transit card, the ferry is included.",1,train

The wall is very busy at Tower 14 buy got quieter as we walked along it. It is very steep in parts so may not suite those who are less able.  The Toboggan ride was great fun ( you can take a chairlift down if you want) and we were allowed on it despite the age limit being 60!",1,train

Nice to see/people watch, but I prefer to stay away from touristy sites and just wonder off the beaten patch",0,train
The piazza is magical  especially at night when the orchestras are playing at the cafes that surround the square.

There are some stops before you jump on the cable car to allow you to get water, use the toilet and get the tickets for everyone. Our tour guide named Michael ( real name wuan jun) did a pretty good job in describing the history of the Great Wall during the journey and while I was with him at the 14th tower. I had plenty of time to then walk all the way to the 23rd tower and back to have lunch around 14h. Definitely recommend for first time visitors!",0,train

"I am a recent and new adherent for the pleasures of the lake boats and transports in this, my favorite tourist country. The boats are for scenic tourism and practical transport (part of the SBB national system).  Despite my numerous visits for hiking adventures, last year, I happened upon the boat across Lake Lucerne for a practical reason- best method of transportation,,, but what a great experience- please see my last year's review for the description of that experience.  So I decided that for this year's trip, a proper Lake Lucerne journey would be the start of my trip. The incredible crazy itinerary that I did was to land at Zurich Flughafen at 0810 and I was on the boat by 1012- fantastic quick 20 minutes from plane to train , and the boat landing is across the street from the train station.  Now I could not believe how many hundreds of people were admitted to that boat, but it did not sink nor collapse from the load. Being an overenthusiastic tourist, I did not sit for a moment- walking from one end to the other and one side to the other- taking all the photos that you can see her- linked to this review.  I can say it all in a few words- I loved it. It is so smooth; it is so classy; it is so professional; it is so romantic; it is so lovely; it is so scenic; it is so unique.  Hey- you can sit at a table and have a real meal (I didn't do that).  You can see the famous mountains from a different perspective (see my recent reviews of Mt. Pilatus and Mt. Rigi).  Note that the boat remains crowded until Vitznau, where about 200-300 people disembarked at one time.  I continued to Brunnen on a much more spacious craft.  Don't forget to go to the bow and the stern- to see the bell and to see the gigantic Swiss flag flapping in the breeze (see my photos).  I disembarked at Brunnen- another of the endless number of scenic Swiss villages (everywhere and including along lakes). From there it was a five hour train journey via the Bernina Express to St. Moritz (please read about that on my profile too).  What a glorious start of my annual visit!!  This lake boat excursion is so recommended... and if you can, go on the BAV- that is the paddle boat- you can see the machinery in action on the lower floor and you can also see the rapidly churning paddles that propel the boat.",1,train

"We stayed in the Old Quarter for 3 nights when we were in Hanoi over Christmas. There is lots to get up to or you can sit at a restaurant and people watch. The French architecture is stunning.  Most of Hanoi’s must see attractions are within the Old Quarter, such as Ngoc Son Temple on Hoan Kiem Lake, One Pillar Pagoda, Bach Ma Temple, Water Puppet Theatre, Opera House, National Museum of Vietnamese History, Ba Dinh Square and Dong Xuan Market. There are a lot of other must see attractions nearby and with in walking distance. Such as the Temple of Literature and the Hanoi Hilton Prison. Most attractions entrance fees costed around 30,000VND ($1.75CAD). The streets are narrow and always busy. Full of cars, scooters and pedestrian. Lots of locals going about their day.  There is a hop on/of bus options. If you are not wanting to walk. It also takes you into the other districts of Hanoi to some must see attractions.  We chose to use Grab Ride (app) if we were leaving the district. It was cheap and you always knew how much you were going to be charges before you order the ride. Pretty much the same as Uber.  In the evenings the streets filled with locals and tourists for some fun! Some of the narrow streets where closed down to traffic. The odd scooter still snuck through.

we took the short ferry ride over and just walked around for a few hours. We should have done a tour as we had lots of unanswered questions.

Old Town offers everything a resident needs from tin smith to bamboo ladders to food.",0,train

"Great experience for me and my 12-year old son! The ride up provided a stunning view and the ride down was sheer fun. But the wall itself, and the history of the wall, was captivating. We went in November so it was really (really) cold. Bring gloves, especially for the toboggan ride down. And wear sturdy shoes for the uneven floors and many, many steps. The views from the watchtowers are incredible--you'll want to take photos. We kept our visit short--maybe an hour and a half walking on the wall--which was just right for my son's attention span.",1,train

It is not possible to see the beautiful interior space that you see in photographs. It has a hideous carpet throughout so you can't even see the floor. It has been stripped of any images that do not fit with it being a mosque. It was not even possible to see the Byzantine mosaics that remain. These were off limits to visitors with a guard blocking the entrance to them. A huge disappointment.",0,train
We took a trip by car around Europe for 3 weeks at the start of August 2018. This was our favourite place. When driving in the scenery is beautiful/breath taking. We stayed at a campsite in Vitznau as we couldn't get on a site near Bellagio which is a more cosmopolitan. They had camping pitches that overlooked the lake and we were lucky to get one. The swimming pool also overlooked the lake. We ate at a lakeside restaurant in the evening and watched the sun setting on the mountains. There was a little Swiss brass band playing in the village/town and everyone was merry and friendly. Unfortunately we were on our travels again the next day but we will go back. The cable cars up the mountain face must be a fabulous experience!!,1,train

And imperative for young tourist and children to visit as it has plenty of information regarding various regimes who have ruled Finland and with it's museum it also demonstrates how it has changed over the years. I visited in month of February so it was chilly, windy and peaceful. But pretty much could imagine how beautiful it would be in summers with its numerous cafe fully operational. I had good time, it is very well maintained, clean and beautiful place to visit. Also special mention regarding the architecture and planning for building sea fortress.",0,train
"Definitely worth visiting if you've got more than a day in Helsinki. It's only a short and cheap ferry ride from the city - the ferry runs frequently during summer peak season. Great maps of the island freely available.

We wanted to also go onto the arena platform/floor that looks up towards the stands but was told by an officious woman at the exit that we needed a different ticket for this which was a shame.",0,train

As you can imagine this didn't work out as we planned!

You can buy or have anything made here.  It was fascinating to see and then we found the 4 storey market building. This market is crammed full of vendors with hardly any room to walk down aisles between stalls. The vendors were often sitting on the stall as there was no room for them to stand.  Some bartering was done and a few little nic-naks were purchased. It seems that bartering is a big deal here but we soon found that settling on around 70% of the original asking price was agreeable to everyone involved. It was good fun.  We found vendors to be very friendly and we're going back to see if we can find some of the shops we previously found and buy some more gifts.",1,train

We were able to ""skip the line"" however this doesn't help with the security line.  While it is overall an impressive structure, I didn't find myself in awe.

"Stayed in the old quarter - Adamas Hotel.  The area has so much history - good and bad. Ask guides for background if you haven't read up on it or if what you read was confusing without the context.  Look out for all the little alleys and explore inside.We were there just at the start of Corona, and things were shutting down from Hanoi down to the south.  We were so lucky - all the way down to HCMC - only having one trip cacelled  on our last day.  Many Hanoi people were not very friendly / approachable.  90% of tourists were caucasian and I believe locals felt we were bringing in the virus (?).  The small tourist numbers were definitely a boon for us!

Bargain!!! (about 60%?)Still have a lot of French arcitecture.  Narrow buildings but look up.  each floor often houses a different business - so you havw to climb.Cabs are cheap.

"Visited the Wall on November 11. Wife and I hired a taxi that took about 1-1/2 hrs from Beijing's Park Plaza Hotel Wangfujing. Upon arrival, we purchased tickets with no waiting as we got there around 8:45 am on a weekday. Paid for the bus ticket that takes you a little ways up the hill, before transferring onto the ski lift type tram.  Worth the price since it's a decent hike up the stairs to the Great Wall.  Save yourself the  energy for hiking on the Wall itself. Cable car lets you off at tower 14. From there you can choose to walk to the left or right along the Wall.    We hiked for about 2-1/2 hours round trip, making a left when we got to the wall.  Could not go further beyond tower 23. Going early enabled us to avoid any heavy crowds.  There are some fairly steep uphill portions, especially the last stair leading to Tower 23.  You literally will be climbing the stairs with help from your hands on the steps above you. Definitely worth the time to climb the Wall.",0,train

We went during the Covid outbreak and in my opinion this improved out experience dramatically as there were hardly ant tourists in Dubai at this time and therefore not many people visiting. The views are amazing but the price to get to the highest floors was a bit too much in my opinion so we just went to the 124th and 125th floors. Be aware that the only way you can buy tickets there is if you pay through the nose to go to the highest floors or buy with other attractions. We wasted time by not realising this and had to book tickets for the Burj on line outside of the queue as we did not want to got to any of the other attractions  offered such as the aquarium.,1,train
See title. I would also suggest that you not bother with the audio guide. There is enough information written in English next to the limited areas of interest to be found inside. It really needs an  interactive type of guide/app that gives you artist impressions of what this building looked inside like during its many reincarnations.,1,train

Yes street vendors but not aggressive and of course, St. Marks Church.",0,train

Before we started our trip we watched a travel show on TV about this Piazza and we wanted to see the architecture, the horses, the clock, and the beauty of the Basilica and other architecture.  We had lunch at one of the open-air restaurants in the Piazza - both for the food and for a place to sit.  Oh and there are pigeons!  There are very few places in Venice or this Piazza to sit and enjoy the beauty, unless of course you sit to eat a meal or sit on bridge steps.  Several vendors sell t-shirts, bags, hats and artwork to tourists in the Piazza.",1,train

"Without a doubt one of the most unforgettable experiences I got to share with my mother-- summiting The Great Wall. We traveled by Didi (China's version of Uber) and it took just over an hour from city centre. We visited in December, arriving at the wall in the afternoon to catch the sunset which was absolutely breathing. The wall was mostly deserted due to it being off peak season so we go some really awesome pictures and enjoyed the wall mostly to ourselves. Also in winter I would recommend going in the afternoon as the mornings can be bitterly cold. Also to note in winter the sun goes down much early just after 5pm and it's completely dark by about 5:30pm. We took  a return trip cable car up the wall 120 yuan and a shuttle to the start of the wall from the ticket office 10 yuan return trip highly recommend. We also purchased all our tickets online so we just had to scan our barcodes and enter very quick and easy. Have a warm coat, gloves, scarf and hat for December and most importantly have layered socks and good walking shoes else your feet will freeze. Truly a bucket list item-- not picture can do justice to being on the actual wall and taking it all in.",1,train
We visited Hagia Sophia on our own which was cheaper than using a tour company. My brother had visited Turkey before so he was my tour guide but there are recordings that one can hire at the site.

"We came here on a windy, cloudy day in early May.  Took the reasonably-priced public ferry from the Helsinki harbor / docks near the Old Market Hall.  A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this is a windswept historic fort worth a visit.  Waves batter the shores and the strong gusts will remove hats, scarves, and other similar items that aren't secured.  Walk around and admire the old defensive mounds and walls, cannons, and excavated storage cave-like shelters where ammunition and other materials were kept safe and dry.

"It's very easy to get to Suomenlinna, we used the ferry that is part of Helsinking's subway system; it's a comfortable scenic ferry ride that only added a few dollars to a day pass for local trains.  There was a main tourist information center that was very nice and had a ton of information including digital displays that let you see and zoom in on the whole island at different times of year and give you tons of information.  The only negative was that throughout the island there was not a whole lot of additional information besides maps so I'm sure there is a ton of history we were unaware of.  If I did it again I would have paid a tour guide.",1,train

You arrive by ferry with a short trip which os expensive if you dont have a travel ticket and are using other public transoort. There is not much info around about the site and no signs or displays about the history. It would be nice to see more signs around the island giving info.

"Sadly I have to give Piazzo San Marco a bad review, not because of the architecture, not because of the overpriced cafes and restaurants but because of the large number of market stands selling cheap tat, all selling exactly the same cheap trash. Is this what has become of the great city of Venice? I'm sure Venice awakes each morning and weeps in its soul at what lies ahead each day. Speaking as a business consultant, I understand that the city and its residents need to maximise the tourist income but this is what is happening. Non-Venetians selling knock-off imported murano style glass and plastic masks doesn't benefit Venetians. The innumerable stands around every great attraction selling imported trash don't benefit Venetians, they benefit the Non-Venetians who flock to the city in the attempt to make money to send home, they benefit the far Eastern industries who churn out the trash. Then there are the cruise ships who will ultimately damage the port area and only benefit the shipping companies. Aside from the local baccari, I was disappointed in the standard of restaurants in the main tourist areas. Any restaurateur who thinks having glossy Wimpey-esque food pictures outside their restaurants and who think having pestering staff trying to persuade customers to come in, is sadly mistaken if they think it makes their establishment more attractive. On a positive note, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in a boutique hotel with wonderful staff and the several small baccari that were off the main tourist tracks. I also enjoyed the architecture even though The Rialto is more like a cheap Sunday Market. VENICE - IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO RECOVER YOUR PRIDE AND STILL HAVE A PROFITABLE TOURIST TRADE.",1,train
"It's more than just a fortress, despite its name. There's a kind of village (they still have residents, so be respectful of their privacy), museums, cafes and countless side-trails you can explore. Suomenlinna consists of several interconnected islands (no cars allowed) that make for very pleasant strolling.  Chief attraction would be the 250-year-old ramparts built by the Swedish and Russians, giving wide views of the Gulf of Finland. Cannons are still mounted on them.  Individually, the buildings on the island are nothing exceptional, though collectively, they are evocative of an earlier military time and more isolated place. Several have been turned into museums and cafes, but some seem to be closed during the off season.  With so much to do, one needs to set aside the better part of the day to truly enjoy the place.  One word of warning: Toilets are rare and far between, especially when museums and cafes are closed.  To get there, take an HSL ferry from the main harbor in front of the President’s Palace. You can buy a ticket right before you board. I forgot to ask the price since I didn't need one. What I had was an HSL day ticket for zone A (i.e. the same day pass for buses, metro and trams) and it included the ferry too.  The ferry takes only 15 minutes to cross the water, giving you nice views of the Helsinki waterfront.  No entry charge to the islands but individual museums will charge for entry.",1,train

"Our first stop while in Helsinki was to visit Suomenlinna. Thus, we caught the ferry from Market Square to the fortress. The ride over to the fortress on a large ferry is less than 15 minutes, and there are regular departures.  The Fortress area is home to about 900 people and a Naval Academy. There is even a store on premise and a half dozen cafés. There are actually several islands connected by bridges. The Fortress is actually “free” to explore whereas the museums are at a cost.  The fortess includes some underground passage and is listed as a UNESCO heritage.  One of the first features you come by is the Church. The church is small and basic. Still, worth looking to.  The Menege Military Museum was by far very interesting as it depicts military artifacts associated with Finland from the 19th century.  There is a German tank, a Rolls Royce Car known as the “Silver Ghost,” and a Maxim machine gun that could dish out 600 bullets in a minute. Close by is also the submarine Vesikko. It is quite small, but still worth a visit  Before you cross over a longer bridge, there is another interesting museum which tells the story of Suomenlinna. The museum is small, but it gives an insight about the location.  This is a must first stop in every visit to Helsinki",1,train

As per the instructions in the email we went to the address (Via Capo d'Africa 15A) prior to the actual visit to redeem the voucher for real entry tickets. At 09:30 we arrived, nobody there, a closed roller shutter. I tried to call the service number, many times, no answer, until today (1,5 days later) no return call. I waited for close to 30 minutes outside with my young girl in the scorching heat. We were about to lose our time slot. We walked to the Colosseum, the people there were friendly and could see we had purchased entry tickets for € 65,- for 10:00 but could not help us without the 'real tickets'. We walked back, still closed. Still no answer on the phone (+390693574837). There is a chat page, I chatted and chatted, zero reactions. Impossible to get in touch or to get tickets....we lost our slot, we lost the money and worst of all we spent more than an hour is the heat and I had to suffer the silent disappointment of my young daughter, her father could not give her what he had promised....and we left. Still until now, I have not heard not did get a reply on anything. They have my phone number, my email, nothing. Not even an apology. SCANDALOUS!!!! I bought new tickets online for a new date/time slot for only € 20,- DO NOT USE VIATOR! The take your money and disappear. That is called theft where I come from.",0,train
Awesome place to come . Was very atmospheric in Dec and would be amazing in summer . Be prepared to walk and divert off the route to explore. The small island with Naval academy on is brilliant as not many people go across and go south past the residence blocks as there is a battery and fortifications that not many people go see and scenery is stunning. Recommend just wrap up warm and enjoy. The Kings gate is worth walk,0,train

"I visited this famous and historical place in October a few times during the day and night.  It is extremely busy during the day with tourist groups queuing up to the churches etc, eating at the cafes and shopping.  It is a place that you need to be careful of pick pockets as you can be easily distracted by the beauty of the place.  It has a magical quality at night with the way the side passages are lit up.  It is the gateway to the canals and worth a wander through.  Great place to have a coffee and people watch after a tour or at the start of the day before you go on a tour.  Depending on what you do there you could stay for less than an hour, a few hours or for the whole day.",1,train

"It is well worth the 1hr drive to go to this part of the Wall.  The views are stunning.  There are far fewer people.  The stairs are steeper - lol!It seemed possible to climb out an observation window from one particular tower.  Looked like you needed help doing this and getting back in.  Then walk/clamber along an ancillary Wall to another observation tower with apparently even better views and no body there at all.  This was said to be quite an unsafe adventure but those that did it said it was worth it (allow half an hour).Getting back down from the Wall has the optional alternative to the cable car of the excitement of a toboggan ride.  Unfortunately, the ""fun police"" on the side every corner are there to stop you doing anything too stupid (like using you camera).  Great end to a fabulous day.  Thoroughly recommend Mutianyu for a better Wall experience.",1,train

"Stayed in central Beijing but wanted to visit a section of the wall which wasn't as touristy as badaling ( closest section to Beijing) . We booked a private driver and visited the Longqingxia gorge in the morning and went to the wall in the afternoon .  It took around 1.45 to get to the this section of the wall . The best part was there wasn't many tourists which meant you could walk the wall leisurely without being rushed and also take photos without getting random people in them .  There are two tickets you can buy . Go up and down in a cable car or go up on a ski lift and come down via the tabogon. We chose the latter option. Both are same price . The price for the ski lift ,entrance to walk the wall and to come back down was about £18! Bargain .  Ski lift up was very scary but safe .  You arrive at the wall at entry point 6. We walked from point 6 to 1 as recommenced by the driver . This section has the best views and is more difficult as it's steep . I think this part isn't as re-made as some other parts of the wall .  The walk took bout hour but OMG , the views were breath taking . Absolutely amazing .  We walked back to point 6 and took the tabogon down which was another experience !! You can slow if you like or faster - there's a hand break .  It's worth visiting this section of the wall for the quite and calm and views .  The best day by far on my travels",1,train

Short steep ride in closed car with 6 passengers after long queue but rewarded with marvellous view of winding path of mainly restored wall and watch towers. The elderly will have problems with large, steep, uneven steps that take you up and down the paths but young and robust will have no problem doing a few stretches in fine weather. Very crowded even on weekday and morning but rewarded with nice group lunch at Farmhouse restaurant with glass front serving local cuisine.

"Mt. Pilates was shrouded in fog as it apparently often is. Since this means no sweeping views, we decided to cruise the lake instead. We took the regular public ferry which makes stops at one set of towns as it wends its way to the other side of the lake and another set as it returns to downtown Luzern. The whole trip took about 6 hours without disembarking. The ferry boat was well appointed and had a sit down coffee shop. Beautiful as the ride was, it still became boring after a few hours. If I were to do it again, I’d take the train to the other side and catch the ferry back. The prettiest sections are at the other side across from Luzern. Alternatively take the ferry out and the train to return. Train fare is cheap, ferry fare is not. There are numerous discounted transportation passes available for travelling across Switzerland that includes Lake Luzern crossing.  The ferry website also offers deep discounts but these have to be purchased from the website ahead of time and are not available at the ticket counter near the time of departure.  Final tip: bring a jacket as it can get really cold.",1,train

"Booked this day tour through Rayna tours. As we rarely venture out these days, went ahead with our booking only after the agent assured us that all precautionary measures were in place and it was safe to take the tour. We opted for a late morning time, as suggested by them to avoid crowding. We parked at Dubai Mall’s Fashion Avenue parking, the closest to reach the entrance for the ‘At the Top’ tour. The place had manageable number of tourists and we were happy to note the extremely high standards of cleanliness, hygiene and safe measures followed. All visitors were maintaining the required social distance and there was no over- crowding. It was safe for us all to relax and enjoy the tour of the place.  After showing our tickets at the counter, we were led down a hallway to the elevators to reach the top floor. The passage gave an insight with pictures on the history and time line prior to the construction of this phenomenal structure. A pleasant hostess gave us a brief introduction prior to the tour and we rode the elevators to the top to enjoy an enchanting and spectacular 360 degree view of Dubai. We stopped at the 124th floor and took our own time to enjoy the view! There are ample opportunities for taking photographs, even professional ones (for an additional cost). A souvenir shop is also enclosed on this level offering loads of memorabilia to remember the visit. From the 124th floor, we climbed to the 125th floor for another splendid view. This place also had a souvenir section and café. Took us a little over an hour to complete and enjoy our visit to ‘At the top – Burj Khalifa’. Enjoyed the pleasant experience!",1,train

"Allocate a full day to Suomenlinna...and then choose what you want to do. (Yes, it's possible to spend a night on the island, and if you really are interested in the kind of history on offer here, consider it).  The island is now considered a city district of Helsinki, with about 850 permanent residents, counting 100 prisoners (it's a low security prison). But it's primarily a tourist attraction.  Although under constant work/maintenance, the island is well presented. It's presented much like the Welsh present castles, mind. If it's not locked, you can go there. If it is locked, it's probably not safe to go there. Make sure your phone is charged - not because you'll need it, but because there are nooks and crannies you can only see with a flashlight.  The island has a number of interesting museums, it has places to eat and drink, and it is large enough that even in the summer it doesn't get hugely crowded.  You can get there by municipal ferry or, in the summer, by a slightly more expensive water bus. The trip is only 15 to 20 minutes, so I honestly don't feel it's worth paying more for the water bus unless you're visiting other islands as well.  If you're interested in 17th-century military history this is a must see. It's also a great place for bird watching.",1,train

Great getaway during chilly winters - just pack your beach wear and a pair of shades and you are all set. Advisable to not drive a car to this place because parking is painful and expensive. Uber/Lyft is the right choice.",1,train

"We visited the Suomenlinna Sea Fortress way out of season and that is the reason for my rating which, I am sure, would be far higher if we had seen the island either in summer, when a picnic and a wander would have been great and all the museums, cafes and retail outlets would have been open; or in winter when snow would have added a magical quality.  The fortress is accessible via the ferry from the station near the Old Market and outdoor market. Ticket machines are located right next to the departure point and you can also use the day or multi-day travel tickets available for the Helsinki travel network., buying a single ticket from the machines was 2.8 Euros. As we were visiting in October and during Covid-19 the ferry and the island were both quiet.  The island is actually a series of islands connected via bridges and accommodates a naval training school plus residential accommodation. During high season there are a number of museums open, but these are closed during the Autumn/Winter.  The ferry crossing - less than ten minutes - is interesting for the view it gives back of the city and a number of tiny islands with buildings clinging to the rocks.  Well worth a visit.",1,train
This was by far the best part of the Great Wall to visit as it was practically empty! Zero crowds but very challenging walk. We walked for an hour and a half up and down the various sized stairs (including stops for photos) before reaching the cafe where you can opt to take a chair lift down or ride the toboggan! It’s super fun but make sure to allow time for the people in front to go down so you can ride at maximum speed. This was the highlight of my trip to China and I’d highly recommend using China Discovery for this tour.,1,train

"As luck has it, we experienced this place while it was hard hit by flood but narrowly missed coming in vain when it had forced closure. Knee high and thigh high boots were essential to be able to tread through the Piazza. Workers set up raised platforms which really saved everyone. There was no taxi service here the day of the flood but the boat ride was efficient given the circumstances. (Make sure you have euros with you as the boat ticket booth is cash only.)  I would completely recommend visiting here outside the Acqua Alta, so perhaps through October. Check weather forecast frequently if you are planning for after October and make sure you are flexible enough with you plan. On any given day, you can have a really enjoyable time exploring the entire vicinity in a day. Be sure to check out the shops and restaurants in the nearby small streets which offer good locally made merchandise and fine food.",1,train

This had restorations going on and there was scaffolding blocking some of the amazing interior. We visited while it was still a museum. The christian aspects of the museum where still in view. I think this has changed now due to it being changed back to a functioning mosque. We wandered around for nearly two hours just amazed at the scale and beauty of the place. It was truly wonderful.

Then she said it was a one-way path and we couldn’t go back. We didn’t go through any gate, any barrier (actually, the ticket gate was about 10 more meters from us) and even so SHE decided we had to leave immediately(her colleague stayed quiet all the time). She was really rude with no reason, since we were polite when talking to her. We asked her name at the end to make a complaint about her behavior, and then she completely FREAKED OUT on us, started shouting, saying she wanted to know our names too and even called security!! Who also stayed silent and didn’t do anything, cause he obviously saw we weren’t doing anything wrong. It would be kind of funny if it didn’t completely ruin our experience.

In the World of the Period in which it was built, no Basilica Plan Building was Covered with a Dome the Size of the Dome of Hagia Sophia and did not have such a large place.  Although the Dome of Hagia Sophia is Smaller than the Dome of the Pantheon in Rome, the Mixed and Sophisticated System Consisting of Half Dome, Arches and Vaults applied in Hagia Sophia Makes the Dome More Impressive by Providing a Much More Spatial Pattern of the Dome.  When Compared to the Domes of the Previous Buildings Built on the Body Walls as a Carrier, Such a Large Dome Fitted on Only Four Stages is considered a Revolution in the History of Architecture both in terms of Technical and Aesthetics.  The Main (Central) Dome, which covers half of the middle nave, has been expanded so that it creates a very large rectangular interior space with half domes attached to its east and west, that when viewed from the ground, it is perceived as a dome dominating the entire interior.  The System Was Completed By Transitioning From Half Domes That Cover The East And West Openings To Smaller Half-Domed Exedras.

All in all the island is a decent experience but the island does need some renovation in places to make it a real 'go to' destination in Helsinki.,1,train

"Yeah the Colosseum is a must to see in Rome. I recommend you to read books about it before the visit, and after choose the unguided visit of the monument. Without guide you're more free in your visit (you can make pauses to take pictures etc...). This is a really great monument, and the visit is really interesting, but Warning: CHOOSE THE GOOD HOURS. I recommend you to visit it at the opening becaause there is less people than in the rest of the day. The access is quiett easy and the souvenir shop is not to expansive. Warning: if you want to eat after your visit, go away from the Colosseum, because it's really expansive and not really good.",1,train

"We were staying at La Siesta hotel on Ma May so we were able to spend a few days doing a few tours around Hanoi but could also walk out of the hotel in the evening and just walk around the Old Quarter and the lake ( 10 minutes from the hotel) . The streets are very busy , wear sandals or sneakers because you need to be agile and prepared to walk mostly on the street as the sidewalks are basically parking lots for motorbikes ! Take a Street-map with you ( the street names are all very similar) The traffic is amazing , just waves of motor bikes , we never saw a single accident ( in 2 weeks !) but the advice to “ walk slowly but steadily” is important . The near -accident we did see was a tourist who panicked and tried to stop in the middle of the street ...... Recommend doing one of the street-walking tours, best way to see the markets and get some food -tasting experience.",1,train

"There are very aggressive guides all around the entrance area trying to sell their services. One pitch they use is that they can save you an hour wait in line. But the wait really wasn’t that long, at least on a Tuesday in Feb.  Just inside the gate before the shack where you buy tickets is a set of kiosks. The most prominent ones sell the Iststanbul museum pass which is expensive and gives admission to a bunch of museums. But the rightmost two machines, which are not prominently marked, sell tickets to the Hagia Sofia at the normal price. No one was using them so I just walked right up and bought our tickets with no wait, then we walked right in. I have no idea why no one else standing in line did that!  Once inside it’s pretty spectacular but not five stars besides there is a lot of it under restoration and blocked off or covered with scaffolding. Still a great visit but not as great as it would be without the construction.",1,train

Bring your camera and capture scenics as well as candids. Also, go high away from the lake and shoot the lake in context of the town and mountains. My DSLR worked well for all these types of photos. Pick an ISA high enough to avoid blurring. A zoom lens with wide-angle is useful for capturing enough of the surrounding to give your photos context.",0,train

"Visiting the Great Wall At Mutianyu, Beijing has been on my list, I am so happy to tick off this attraction now. The great wall of china is surely massive and revered. It is over 6,000 kilometres long and extends over breath-taking scenery. It was cloudy on our day visit; this added a mysterious element to the whole experience. We reached the top via cable car ” or “teleferic. It is a UNESCO listed attraction and definitely worth visiting.  SEE photos.",1,train
San Marco's Square is really crowded in the day and filled with tourists and tour groups meeting up. Go at night to experience the calmer atmosphere and enjoy some music while having dinner or a drink. The experience is very nice!,1,train

"had a truly great day on the Mutianyu part of the Great Chinese Wall. Leaving from Beijing at 7 AM in the start of December in light frost end sun, I really enjoyed the 90 minutes ride. If your driver speaks English, I can only recommend that you interview him/her about the infrastructure under construction etc. you pass on the way to Mutianyu. If you come in Winter, don’t forget to bring warm clothes. As I arrived, there was some centimeters of snow on the North Sides and in the shade. Ski lifts are offered to reach the wall, but I strongly recommend,  that you consider to walk the 200 meters of altitude since this will – so to speak – prepare your mind much better. The track is well marked and in very fine condition. On the top of the wall, you must try to imagine the mongols approaching on horses from North. Read some history in advance. Along the wall, you will find more cafeterias. Prices for a coffee are not cheap, but what a place to enjoy it. Such a Winter day, we had approximately 100 km sight. Magnificent!",1,train

"Visited the Finnish Fortress Island in a small group. We took the local ferry from the market place, 5 euros for 12 hours which covers the return journey. The ferries stick strictly to the timetable, so make sure that if you are in a group, everyone is ready to board at the same time. We watched as a group of people had to wait for a couple more of its members, although the leader asked the ferry to wait half a minute for a couple of late comers, the ferry did not wait and so the group watched as we moved away. The ferry seems to go every half hour or so. Once on the island you can get maps from the info centre located near the Ferry dock. Many of the roads are cobbled stones it is not easy to move a wheelchair around everywhere, although the sides of the roads are slightly more wheelchair friendly. Beware there is quite a steep slope as you get into the fortress. After passing some cafes a large Lutheran church is on your left hand side with large canons forming a fence outside. We went inside to find it big but quite plain. We wandered around the little streets until we came to a wooden bridge. The main info office is just before the bridge, it has a museum, gift shop and cafe. Also this is the place to get a guided tour in English on weekends about 1.30pm, I think it would be worth it as I am sure we would have understood the fortress a lot better. A maze of ramparts, tunnels and military buildings dating back to the 1740's. Here and there were buildings which you could go inside for a small fee, one in the main court yard had been set up as a small museum in the style of the 1700's which was very interesting. You can walk along the battlements and see the canons from the russian times pointing out to sea. Lovely views out to sea a very pleasant walk in good weather, even a swimming beach but already too cold for us. Feeling hungry we decided to go to what appeared to be the main cafe by the bridge. This was a bit of a disappointment as although there was a nice salad table, the main meal on offer was not worth the price we paid. This may have been an off day but check what they offer first at the buffet before committing, we made the mistake of just reading from the sign and not looking first . On the whole, I think that if you have half a day to spare, the Fortress Island is well worth a visit.",1,train

Now that it’s back to being a mosque it is an experience not to be missed. Full of history, from the 6th Century, I wanted to check every space, nook and cranny, but again as some refurbishing work is taking place you only see the main area. Women have their own prayer section which overlooks the men’s section. In the evening and certain times in the day, you’re free to visit both. They sometimes offer women blue scarves to cover modestly, otherwise do bring your own. I visited it several times and couldn’t get enough. A must see. Have to keep mask on at all times and take shoes off at entrance.",1,train

"Easy to reach island from Helsinki market Square. We took the HSL ferrry which is probably the cheapest option costing us Euro 5 for return ticket. Island itself is beautiful, it helped that it was a nice sunny day. We missed the guided tours as we reached there around 4 PM. Blue route is very clearly marked with some information on the boards along the route. They are very informative and we learnt a few things about the island's history. We diverged from the route a few times to explore the island a little more. Overall it took us a couple of hours to complete the mile long route.",0,train

I know it has a very important part to play in Finnish history so obviously they need to keep it much as it was. We needed more time to take it all in.",1,train

"Good once in a lifetime experience. Not worth to go more than once. We went up to level 124/125. This was good enough as we paid only 129AED via official website. At ticket counter itself its more expensive as they only allow you to buy it with a ticket to the aquarium. Night time is the most, sunset would be a nice but I don’t think it would have made the difference. Just pick a bright day not a hazy one. Windows were dirty which was not really good for the pictures. Walking around 360 was possible but only 180 was outside. Overall nice experience but not amazing.",1,train
Did this section of The Wall on an organised tour.I was going to do it independently which would have been cheaper but possibly a longer more complicated journey. We first visited The Emperors Tomb site.Then lunch .Arriving at the car park we were given 2 hours to explore.After receiving our entry tickets we proceeded through the ticket style then towards the cable car .( You can walk up to the wall but I believe it can take over an hour of tough walking.) Please note that from the car park you have to go up a very steep hill to the cable car.There are a few drink sellers and a small shopping area on the hill. The journey on the cable car takes about 6 or seven minutes.From the cable car you have to negotiate numerous steps up to the entry The Wall.The cable car takes you to tower 14 and you can go to the highest tower 20.I managed tower 14 to eighteen before my time was running out and my feet were giving up.There weren’t many people walking on the day I visited but at every tower there were people escaping the suns rays. The exit to The Wall is on a section that has a dip so to get to the starting point it is up a steep path or steps.Then it is down to the cable car and down again to the car park. In closing a really exhausting day but really enjoyable.Please make sure you are fit enough though.One of our group walked with a stick and couldn’t get very far on the wall.There are lots of inclines and steep steps besides the really steep hill up to the cable car and beyond,1,train

The first time I went to Rome I was in high school and you couldn't go inside the Colosseum.  I visited Rome two more times since and never made it to the Colosseum so I was determined this trip to go inside!  We had an awesome tour guide but I think I must have hyped it up too much in my mind.  As a self professed history geek it left a lot to be desired.  It's a must see for sure as it holds so much valuable history but I think if you see it once you're good.,0,train

However, be aware. The Piazza becomes oppressively overcrowded during the 10 am to 5 pm timeframe. To really appreciate it, go early or late. At nighttime, there are bands playing and you can enjoy a drink or coffee while enjoying the atmosphere.",0,train
"I believe this place could tell a few stories and more so than what is known today. I have never stood in an ancient ruin this old before, which I believe is almost 2000 years old, and they kept it going good through out the years as an international landmark. Take a tour and learn how the animals were sometimes used to execute the prisoners, a nice way to go, but things were different back then. Plenty of information about the Gladiators and events that took place as well in the tour. The place feels a lot bigger inside but has the grand appearance outside.",0,train

"Went there on a private tour, VIP parking therefore less uphill walking to the main entrance.  Recommend the cable cars,  you’ll do plenty of walking on the wall.  Use restrooms before going up, none on the wall. They do have a sort of a snack bar at top right after the cable cars exit.  The wall is clean and well preserved.  Once you go up to the wall you’ll have plenty of stairs and lots of walking to do, depending on how far you want to go.  The further you go, the better your photo ops.  We went in the morning and it was foggy and rainy, about an hour later it stopped and cleared up.  Highly recommend this section of the wall.",1,train

"2 July 2020 - A disappointing experience - which can be laid at the door of the official ticketing agency COOPCULTURE.  There is virtually not a tourist to be seen in Rome at the moment, so a great opportunity to visit key attractions, normally a nightmare for the crowds.  Despite standing around in the hot sun trying to download their app (only way to book tickets) we never got in. Their system malfunctioned - despite the cash being taken off my card and getting a confirmation email confirming a successful transaction, they refused to give us tickets and allow entry. When the crowds come back it will be a nightmare.  In addition they were advertising reduced ticket price in the afternoons - which they refused to honour. What a bad experience.....Never got to see the Colosseum from the inside ......",1,train

The great wall is a good 2hr drive from the centre of beijing traffic permitting. We went in November low season and it was still quite busy even though the temperature was 1oC. You can take the cable car or chair lift up to the base of the wall. We took the chair lift. There are a lot of steps up to the wall and on top .There are many more steps as well as undulating path between the towers amazing site worth the visit spectacular but go low season to miss the crowds.,0,train

Tickets are not expensive, and you can even get ""skip the line"" tickets which are not too much more. You can explore the different levels and learning how this huge piece was used in Roman history really makes the experience mindblowing.",1,train

There's so much to hear and see that it was impossible to take in everything, but it's still a worthwhile place to visit, as it really captures the cultural heart of Hanoi.

This is just like it is on the travel brochures but a must see place where you can get some great photographs. I understand there are a number of places to see the wall near Beijing but this is the recommended one. It is about 60/75 minutes outside the capital but well worth taking the trouble to organise a tour. To get to the well takes a bit of walking and exertion as well as a cable car to get to the actual wall. I would strongly recommend to go early to beat the crowds. We were outside the main Chinese holidays but as we were leaving at midday the crowds to reach the wall had increased significantly. It is also good to see the wall without the crowds. Unless you want to take a walk up and down many steep hills there is limited places to walk and you need no more than an hour on the wall itself. A must see - you would be mad to miss it,1,train

We did not do a guided tour here, but many people do, however we felt like we could learn quite a lot from the different exhibits and signs throughout. We did purchase our tickets in advance which I would also highly recommend! You will save yourself at least 30 minutes to an hour of waiting in line to buy the tickets & then security, so if you plan to visit the Colosseum I would get your tickets in advance.",0,train

We made a reservation on line with Travelocity, and accidentally booked the wrong day.  When we called to change it the representative said it was non-refundable and no changes could be made.

If you really want to appreciate this Piazza set your alarm for 5:30 or 6AM and wander down there with a coffee. There are no crowds then and you can enjoy the magnificence of the architecture. Anytime after 0830 the crowds start appearing and it is hard to even walk through the Piazza.

Also, there are plans for even taller structures to be built during the coming decades, both in the UAE and abroad, so you should visit Burj Khalifa soon while it still holds that honour, if only once.",0,train

I guess this is one of the perks with visiting during the current Pandemic. On that note, I can say we were impressed wherever we were, with how clean everything was, how much cleaning alcohol gel was available everywhere, and how everyone were wearing masks properly.

We also really liked the gift shops, which had nice selections of gifts a souvenirs for reasonable prices. Great service and very friendly people, like everywhere in Dubai!",0,train

Going to Dubai without admiring the view from Burj Khalifa is like visiting Paris without going to the top of the Eiffel Tower. With the height, we admire even more the architecture of Dubai.

The best part of this monument is that wherever you are in Dubai it is omnipresent. Even in the sum parts of the desert the Burj Khalifa is visible at night. At the top experience is also pretty decent. I think there could be some more activities other than just photography up there. The atmosphere of the places quit average. The time when you are in the elevator JNU travelling at a very high speed to the top is really good without coins of music playing in the elevator you can really feel the pressure in your ears because the higher altitude. The scenes from the above beautiful I have experienced this two times and both of the times I went there at night because I feel that their lights are more beautiful to watch at night.,1,train
The fortress is a short boat ride away and you can catch the ferry from the harbour. On the island there are plenty of things to visit and simply having a walk around at your own pace is enjoyable. There are numerous cafe's located across the island so be sure to grab a map from the information centre on arrival or you can get lost pretty quickly. Each part of the island has information boards with the history of the island and Helsinki on them and its fair to say the information was very interesting. Well worth a visit,1,train

This is the most charming neighbourhood of Strasbourg. The architecture is typical of this part of Europe but it is unique because of the concentration of well preserved buildings along the canal/river running through the city.

There are also some very interesting restaurants and stores/boutiques on some of the main streets.,1,train
This is a not-to-be-missed attraction in Rome so naturally we visited it. It'd be strange to go to Rome for the first time and not visit the Colosseum. I was not so impressed as I was by other more beautiful sights but the history surrounding it and of it is actually really cool. It is highly recommended to buy a skip-the-line ticket with a tour or company because it will help you save time and stress. It doesn't mean that you won't have to stay in line but means that you'll have a person to guide you and be in queues for tour groups. Our tickets were included a guide so it was really helpful as he was a very knowledgeable guide and brought to life the whole thing.

One has to be careful when walking, as due to the numerous, and did I say numerous motor scooters on the sidewalks you can't really use the sidewalk.  You will need to weave your way into the traffic, and around the shop keepers doing business on the sidewalk.   There are numerous street markets and vendors all trying to sell their wares.

Then it changed hands to the Russians and finally back to the Finns.  I strongly suggest reading up the history before heading out or join a tour.  There is a church - Lutheran converted from Orthodox.  There are several cafes, restaurants, a souvenir store and museums.  It is a place where several hundred people call home.  A ""little bird"" told me that the navy apparently is still present there.  The same ""little bird"" also told me that parolees are on the island as well.  Do explore the nooks and crannies.

"This stunning, originally Christian Church, then Islamic Mosque and now Museum is an architectural wonder that gets far less notoriety than it deserves.  Starting life as the Capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD this magnificent building has interesting stories to tell from the ancient world to the current day.  This is the very spot the Roman Empire ended and Istanbul was born and the Ottoman Empire fornd immortality. The battle of the Sultan to finally take what was then called Constantinople is well worth researching before you visit to help appreciate the enormity of the building and city in the ancient and modern world.  The battle and subsequent victory of the Sultan changed history as we know it and was also the first time WMD was used in warfare. The tactical game of war chess that unfolded here is testimony to the young Sultans tactical genius and was a huge loss to Rome who took far too long to come to Constantinople's aid and lost this part of the world forever to the Turks.  You can simply wander around and enjoy the space and the wonderful mix of Christian and Islamic artwork or you can deep dive into learning about it's origins and how the Sultan removed all Christian artifacts and plastered over all Christian artworks to replace them is Islamic art and symbols. The plaster has been painstaking removed but this is why you can still see traces of it today.  Don't miss the walkway up to the upper level on your immediate left as you enter as the upper level has stunning views and yet more secrets to reveal.  Keep an eye out for the Viking graffiti and slow yourself pause for thought as you walk past the doors to heaven and hell.  If you prefer not to research before hand It's well worth considering hiring a guide on the day to talk you through this magnificent monument.",1,train

Each bend has a new incredible view that was totally different from the last especially when the top of the mountains are covered in mist and clouds.

Every time I saw it I wanted to take another picture.We took the boat trip to Alpnachstadt as a part of the Golden Circle.  Let me highly recommend the Golden Circle because you get the boat ride as well as the funicular train and cable car.  While the mountain is great, the various modes of transportation allow you to see it in such different ways.  You can't really experience the lake without getting on it.",1,train

We passed through it at least once a day and often two or more times (our visit was only a little over two days). Our first night, a choir was singing not far from the Basilica and while the music was a little cheesy (think Up with People in the US—although we spoke to some of the singers afterward and they were all from Italy), it was still a wonderful experience. They have other public art projects there: we looked online hoping there would be others but they were not during our visit.

There is no charge. Pre book Doges palace and beat the line. It’s the only thing I would book. If you are driving to Venice park in San Marco Car park (€30 Euro per day) and use the water bus to get you to your hotel. Make sure you know which terminal you are close too. You can buy a water pass for €7.50 and do a complete loop of all the stops without getting off. It takes 1hr 15 but you see all the islands and sites cheaply.

I was a bit disappointed with the place really. We went in Winter which was still busy but a lot of the cafes and restaurants were closed. Also the walkways and paths were not maintain very well so it took a lot of effort trying to not fall over. In my opinion they should close it down over the winter. If it is oen then it should be made more easily accessible and have cafes and restaurants open. The fact that things weren't open didn't really bother me. The main issue was trying to stay on my feet. The ferry ride isn't too bad though. It only took 10 minutes and cost 5 euros each. Return. Probably worth the trip  in summer.,1,train

The streets, particularly Rue du Bain-aux-Plantes and narrow lanes are cobbled and lined with quaint shops and eateries. Beautiful historic stone bridges cross the canals, one, the Ponts Couvert has large square stone towers, you can get a great view of this bridge from the terrace of Barrage Vauban, a covered defence bridge, well worth a visit.

"This is worthwhile seeing for several reasons - the scenery, the history involved in the wall, seeing the sheer scale of what was done.  It's quite easy to visit, as the majority of the climbing is done by the gondola, which takes you up to an observation platform.  From here you can go in either direction.  The first part in either direction is quite level.  If you want more of a challenge, you can go walk to the left from the observation platform along the wall, and go as far as station 19.  The last part in this direction is quite steep and climbs far up the mountain.  In fact, the final staircase was so steep that I went up on all fours, as a slip or a fall would potentially have caused injury - so be careful if you go this far.  It was worthwhile, though.Our tour bus arrived just at opening time, and it was not crowded at all.  By the time we left about four hours later it was packed - so try to come early if you can.

It doesn't come for, like some people think, patriotic or architectural reasons, but from the ""hospise of the syphilitic"" then called Französenkrankheit (""French disease"") in German. Absolutely must see, walk, relax and enjoy!",1,train

How do you describe the Great Wall and do it justice?  It is so OVER THE TOP amazing and special!!!  The craftsmanship and beauty are awesome!!!  Very beautiful vistas and every place you look could be a painting!  Couple of pointers: 1) wear very comfortable shoes and clothing! 2) bring a hat and warm coat.  It can be very windy and cold! 3) bring water! 4) the slide going down is worth the whole trip to China!!!,0,train

Walking through the stone towers and along the stone paths will have you marvelling at the skill of the Wall's construction and at the intensity of the labor involved.

"I first visited Hanoi's Old Quarter in 1994. It was dull; grey; soulless. It reminded me of East Berlin in the early eighties. Not so now; it has come alive - seriously alive. The streets are filled with people, street vendors, shops, and vibrant pubs. Gone are the Ao Dai and pedal bikes; in is the latest fashion and motorbikes. It is a fusion of noise, colour, aromas, and wall to wall happy and pleasant people simply enjoying the experience.  At the weekend, Dong Kinh Nghia Thuc Square and surrounds are closed to traffic. People take over in their 1000s. On a Sunday evening, it seems the whole of Hanoi descends to enjoy: just walking and chatting; street food; impromptu dancing; and don't be surprised if someone approaches you just to speak English. I was strolling around soaking up the atmosphere when the most incredibly confident, yet sweetly innocent 9-year-old girl just walked up to me, waved and said, ""Hello! Can I speak English with you?"" An hour later we hugged to have our picture taken by her parents, who had sat patiently some 10m away perfectly happy for their little girl to chat to a complete stranger, before saying goodbye. The trust, respect and shear innocence of the Vietnamese is so refreshing and an absolute joy to experience and be part off. Close by is the Temple of the Jade Mountain - a must see, especially if you like photography.  On my second night, Vietnam were playing Indonesia at football in Bali. The atmosphere in the Quarter was electric. The Vietnamese were fiercely patriotic - the girls as much as the boys, if not more so - but in the nicest possible way: there was humorous banter between rival fans, not vulgarities; there were hugs, not fists. The Vietnamese welcomed everyone to their party.  And it was on that night that I finally grew a pair and partook in a Suicide Absinth Super Strong Cannabis shot at the Prague Pub: 100% absinth made with 8 herbs and blended with real cannabis seeds and 89.9% alcohol by volume. Allegedly, it's the ""strongest absinth you can ever get"". Go on - I dare you hehe!  A multitude of French Colonial and Chic Boutique hotels allow you to immerse yourself in the Quarter throughout your stay. And their customer service is excellent.  As with the rest of Vietnam [except Ho Chi Minh City] Hanoi and The Old Quarter are extremely safe and suitable for all travellers: young and old; singles and families.",1,train
"The colosseum is very impressive. However, and this is key, there is not a lot of information inside to help understand the intricate details of what you are looking at, and what it used to be like. This is my second time inside the colosseum, the first I had no guide and the second time (today) we had a guided tour. The guided tour was excellent with Rome tours with kids (see separate review), and this brought the experience to life. A guide will also arrange skip the line tickets which is a huge advantage.  Covid19 means you need to wear a mask inside (you can find a corner to remove if needed), and like at all sights in Rome your temperature will be checked upon entry (no biggie).  I am not a fan of wearing masks, but you do get used to it (especially as everyone else is wearing one). The huge advantage to tourists during COVID19 is that Rome is operating at probably 20% tourist capacity - visiting Rome now is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see the sites in relative piece and quiet, without the absolutely huge crush of tourists. Plus it is nice to help locals who really need the tourist “dollar”.",1,train

"Lake Luzern is beautiful. Cruise is wonderful.  Ships are beautifully maintained.  Very, very highly recommend this experience.  --Lake Lucern Navigation Company offers a self guided tour to Mt. Rigi which we purchases on Viator.  We have purchased tours all over Europe and this was bizarre.  If I didn't have a smart phone with the advertisement for the cruise, I wouldn't have known where to go.  The voucher didn't have information.  When I brought it to the man at the Lake Lucern boarding doc, he looked at us like we were nuts and said just get on.  There was six different parts to the tour so I just referred to the advertisement to figure out what to do next.  Thankfully, Viator has that well written ---but very bizarre.  They should give you something so you know what to do.  Imagine if it was a senior citizen who wasn't able to look up information on phone, etc......  We found our way and it was a very nice day.  Everyone took our tickets.  -- We also spent time sitting on the lake on the evenings when we were there --lovely.",1,train

Hagia Sophia is a definite must see when in Istanbul! So much history and the architecture is breathtaking.,0,train
"Unfortunately the Muslims vandalized the church so do not get your hopes up as so many people have hyped this building.  In my opinion the Ottoman architecture simply dwarfs this basilica and inside nothing remains except two images of Jesus one mosaic in which he is making a Buddhist mudra sign with his hand and another but both of them only partially remain as the conqueres literally tore the images off the walls and graffitied the entire ceiling in Arabic.  It is quite depressing.  However the Blue Mosque is absolutely gorgeous and is right next door.  There were some interesting elements including tombs outside the church and the ancient walkways leading to the second level of the church with the lovely partial mosaic mentioned upstairs but the church is a trashed relic and not the incredible splendor that so many make it out ot be.,  It was probably gorgeous in 400 AD however it has been completely trashed and little remains I was extremely dissapointed in it as I am from a Christian Background.  At the same time I appreciate fine architecture and realize that the Hagia Sophia cannot compete with the aesthetic of the Ottoman.  Ottoman architecture is astounding and much more impressive than any other architecture in Europe(Istanbul is Europe). Be warned if you are expecting to see a beautiful in tact church.  This should be labeled a ruin as that is what it is.  From the outside it is impressive but it is an eyesore inside for aesthetes.  If you are an historian or a very religious Christian without a great aesthetic perhaps you'll like it. I took many more photos of The Blue Mosque.  I found this place depressing but I guess Erdogan's regime is not going to put money into restoring a Christian monument-Obviously not.",1,train

"We booked this one as we wanted to go as high as possible, it was a slick operation, however it was a large group, some going for the 'Sky' part and some of us doing the lounge, this made it tricky to actually listen to what the guide was saying.  They should really have split the groups and had a guide for each one, this would have made it easier.  We enjoyed a lovely drink on arrival, we were then able to move freely around levels 154-152, going inside and out. There were nibbles also being passed around, which was a lovely touch.  Staff were on hand to help, support or just get extra drinks, if you wanted them. A lovely lounge area to sit and admire the view.From there, we could go to all the other levels on the way down and enjoy what they had seen.  Having been to the upper levels, the lower ones were more difficult for picture opportunities, you have more glass in the way to navigate past.

the Old Quarter of Hanoi is alive and well.  Shops line the streets and you are walking the streets because motor scooters are all parked on the sidewalks.   You have to keep your head on a swivel because traffic comes at you from every angle.  If you decide to cross the street...once you see your opening you go for it and don't stop or hesitate.   Just keep your eyes wide open and you will do fine.  After the second day it becomes like second nature to you and you get into the groove of the city.   It is incredible.  Buildings that go back 150 to 200 years are still occupied and being lived in and worked in.   Once you check into your hotel get a street map and walk every square inch of the city.  We did!   We walked 16 miles one day and close to 12 the next day just up and down streets and side streets.   7.5 million people live in Hanoi and you definitely feel it.  People are everywhere and moving all the time.  Motor scooters are flying by and everyone has something to sell.   You definitely want to go to the big open central market.

"This whole area is loaded with things you must do on a visit to Istanbul. The site is inscribed on Unesco’s World Heritage list, which recognises the “architectural masterpieces” of Istanbul.  Be aware that it needs to be seen NOW as it is in the middle of a controversy. Islamists have long prayed for the Hagia Sophia to reopen as a mosque, arguing that its neutral status is an affront to the Ottoman caliph’s decrees forbidding other uses.  The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pledged to revert the 6th century Hagia Sophia, once an important Greek Orthodox Christian cathedral, into a mosque from its current status as a museum. It has been a museum for almost 85 years, which is widely regarded as a compromise between Christians and Muslims who both claim the space as hallowed ground.  A Christian group is arguing for a return to it being a Greek Orthodox Christian cathedral.  Either way, see it now and be amazed at the elements of both religions on view.  PS: It cost $15 to get in. There can be long lines. I am disabled and I went to the front of the line and showed my Social Security card. They waved me in for no cost.

"I’m so glad that we went to Suomelinna! The ferry ride out helps to impress with the distance and importance of having such a great strategic position to guard Helsinki.  once you get out to the islands, they turn out to be more extensive than you can appreciate from a map, or from the point where you land. As you walk further and further from the landing point, you see all the military buildings, barracks, storehouses, churches, and fortifications that were built over time. There was truly a major effort to develop such a stronghold, which sadly was out of date before WWII.  I enjoyed walking through the bastion walls, and climbing along the parapets where the gun emplacements were. It is nice to see people enjoying the beach below, and children climbing on the the old cannons rather than soldiers waiting. One surprise was the number of restaurants on the fortress, which makes it as much a dining experience as a historical one.  Not sure why you need them all, but it is good to know you won’t go hungry.  Advice: take the JT ferry if you want to just do a one-way trip across the island, as it stops at the main stop, midway, and at Kings Gate.  If you don’t mind walking back to the main quay, then take the city ferry (uses the AB tram / subway ticket), which is easy and cheap if you you are buying a day ticket anyway.",1,train

"My husband and I visited South Beach Wednesday afternoon, a couple of days prior to Valentines Day. Our hotel (Stardust) provided chairs & an umbrella to use; however, we didn’t find them adequate so we rented the facilities equipment.  It cost $60 to rent three items, which I thought was very costly. Besides the cost, the customer service was great!!  King went out of his way to ensure our umbrella and chairs were properly set; he even tried to assist putting up the equipment that we brought to the beach. I witnessed him engaging with other guests and his customer service was phenomenal!!  The only downfall is my husband and I were not aware that Mr. King worked off tips and could have missed the opportunity to reward him for a job well done.  Great job King, keep up the good work!!!!   I would have given it a 5 star rating, if it wasn’t for the cost of renting the equipment and snack selections.",0,train

We had a perfect weather and could see the wall in all it's glory, truly breathtaking and emotional experience.

"What an amazing experience it was to be at the Great Wall.  We took the cable car to #13.  Then we walked as far as #19.  It was quite a trek, with uneven steps and a variety of levels, but it was so worth it.  The views from the wall are incredible.  But it's mind boggling to stand there and realize that this was built so long ago and to realize its massiveness.  We checked it from our bucket lists.",1,train

Today, people live here, there are several museums and cafes, and wonderful picnic areas.  It was a leisurely day to walk around and learn about the history.  One must take a ferry to visit the site.  There are some combo tickets available so check into your best option.  Be sure to see the submarine!",1,train
Ayasofya is a big and beautiful Mosque (Church) that hasn't any special thing rather than other mosques,0,train
"Everyone walks through San Marco to get anywhere and everywhere in Venice. Tourists think they have to have a drink sitting at the cafes. You should. But be prepared for ridiculously expensive fare. A tea, coffee and a sticky bun was about £35! You can sit at the cafes for hours and watch the world go by but who wants to when there is so much to see? Do it once and then don't bother. But the square is phenomenal and not just walking through but appreciating the buildings, the design, the centre of the city, are all well worth it. Be careful. Many many people and although there is no where to get to if you are a criminal, there are pickpockets and the crowds are dense. Just be smart and aware and you'll be fine. Oh, and don't forget to try and stay away from the pigeons who descend by the 100s especially when you are eating.  Some fool is always feeding them and they inevitably are sitting next to you. Have fun. A wonderful city.",1,train

The day we went the sun was out and there was no wind. Just buy a ticket and climb aboard the ferry. It was lovely exploring the fortress and discovering more about the history of Finland and how closely it has been entwined with Sweden and Russia. Lots of walking involved with some spots taking you to dead ends that require you to retrace your steps (more signposts and notices providing information would be great). Lovely way to spend half a day or more in Helsinki.,0,train
"Oh my gosh, were do I began, the entire experience was amazing! My sister and I were traveling to Hong Kong in April of 2019 and wanted to visit the Great Wall while in China. I don't recommend doing what we did, but thank God that it worked out really well for us. We didn't have much time in Beijing, so once we obtained our 144 hours transit visa, we waited around the airport until 7am and by the doors of PEK airport there were people soliciting rides to the wall.  The ride to the wall was less than 1.5 hours and once we got there the taxi driver parked in the parking structure and we were able to purchase our tickets from inside. We had the option to purchase the cable car ride along with the ticket, which we did. My sister purchased the tickets and I'm thinking it's because they didn't accept credit cards, so be mindful of that and make sure, before getting there. There was an ATM there in the lobby though. My only complaint with the ticket purchase was that we paid extra for our ticket as it had like a postcard attached to it and we didn't understand the addition in fee when they sold it to us, so if you're not interested in the expensive post card, then make sure to get the cheaper ticket. Once we got our tickets, we then walked and waited no more than 15 minutes for the free shuttle bus that takes you up to the entrance, that is full of freaking wide stairs! Anywho, once you make it up there we went on the scariest cable car up into the freaking trees to the wall! Okay it was a really nice and new cable car with an excellent and safe set up, I'm just terrified of heights thus was NOT ideal for me, but I mustered through with hands over my face and a few tears shed, but once we got there I was like a kid at Disneyworld! I was in total awe, it was amazing! Many of the stairs are very steep to go up to the watch tower portions, but it's worth conquering the fears that you may have! I'm soo thankful that we went. Oh we went in early April and I was freezing! The sun was out, but I was super cold. I had on thick athletic leggings, long sleeve tee-shirt, hooded sweater, and gloves and my sister had to give me her coat! But again it was worth it!  Upon your departure there's places to buy food, nothing too desirable, but if you're starving, it would serve it's purpose. There's also tons of shops where you can purchase items and souvenirs.",1,train

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed climbing this portion of the Great Wall. It thrills you to know that this construction was erected over 2000 years ago and helped protect China from her enemies.

"We were stunned at the magnificence of the Piazza as we entered from the SE sottoportego under the Correr Museum, all those columns and symmetry and stonework of the Basilica and Doge's palace. As you make your way across the Piazza the music from the coffee shops, dazzling stores and crowds of people overwhelms your senses. the must see tourist stops are the Doge' Palace, Basilica, Correr Museum (entrance at the NE corner of the Piazza), Clock Tower, Bell Tower, and maybe you would want to take your Gondola ride from there. Book your entrance fees in advance on line.Go early in the day, the crowds start to build around 10 AM, especially BAD if there is a cruise ship in port. A front of the line pass is advisable in the Summer season, A tour is ok but you can rent the audio units and proceed at your own pace. You might want to blow your budget by having coffee etc at one of the places along the S and N sides. The PERFECT place for lunch is the shop in the Correr Museum. Nothing really wow for lunch, BUT, sit by the window for the SPECTACULAR view of the Basilica and Piazza. TEN STARS!",1,train

"First thing to consider when going there, is to chose your transportation wisely. We went with ""J-T Lines"", which was not the best choice as the boats are small and, most importantly, it drops you off only at the middle of the island. So, either way you want to do the island, you have to walk it all again to get back to the pickup station. Better chose another company, who will drop you at King's Gate and pick you up at the main dock.  Once on the island, there are several places to see and visit, although not all being worthy. For instance, the submarine is a scam at 7 Euros per person for a 2 minute visit.  On the day of our visit, the Church was not accessible as there was a wedding taking place. This is a shame, as it is considered one of the highlights of the island.  The Kustaanmiekka sand banks and artillery is a good section to walk, seeing the old cannons facing the ocean. Around the King's gate, there are also underground tunnels to explore which are fun. On a day that would not be as hot (we had the historical high temperature on the day of our visit), the area of the Manège militaire would have been nice to explore as well.  In terms of food, there are not so many affordable options on the island. But, we found that Pizzeria Nikolai was decently priced and the pizza was rather good.  Expect to spend about 2,5 to 3 hours on this island... maybe closer to 3 if the weather is nice.",1,train

Climbing the stairways to reach the wall may be very challenging for many, as well as actually walking on the wall may be too taxing for most.

I personally liked hania Sofia more than blue mosque, probably because blue mosque has been under construction for the longest time.",0,train

"We saw it from the canal and liked the story and the old buildings. Also we saw it from the little train that goes around the city again with tour guide commentary. It was too hot to visit later on foot as it's around a kilometer from the centre, near the cathedral. We were advised to go there and climb a building for a great photo op; we didn't. You may wish to confirm on your own. (?)",0,train
"Its more than an hours drive to reach mutianyu great wall section ,this section is best for many reason ,its less crowded have cable or chair car to reach on top and its picturesque. This section is newly renovated. After walking a bit from the bus parking you reach the base from where you get the cable car which is worth as you need to keep your stamina for the walking part on the wall. It was a chilly morning , so was quite hazy and less crowded so you get many photo ops , once u be there you get that feeling and all the stories regarding the wall (all the good and the bad ones)  If you happen to be in Beijing you need to come here .",1,train

We were on an excursion that included a boat ride on the lake as a way to get to another destination. We had our own tour guide describing what we were seeing through a listening device we wore.

"Ok, this lake is beautiful and all, but honestly the main attraction is that old bridge and that’s it. I walked on the old bridge and experienced the heritage stuff, but it was quite underwhelming. I’m not saying that I don’t like it, but it was just ok. Nonetheless, the lake is beautiful and the bridge gives it a nice touch, and there are so many restaurants and cafes around. You could spend a bit of time here, but I can easily imagine that it would get very boring after a while.",1,train
"The city of Lucerne seems to be on every tourist itinerary. It's beautiful, but was also the most crowded place we visited in our two weeks touring Switzerland in late August. So, a boat trip on this stunning lake in the late afternoon on a Friday was a welcome relief from the crowds. There are numerous private boats and tours that can be taken around the lake, but an inexpensive option are the SGV Vier Waldstattersee ferries that the locals use to get from town to town along the lake. Some of the Swiss Rail passes include these ferries in the pass (be sure to check before you buy unnecessary tickets for the ferry). You can ask at the ferry ticket building on the pier outside the train station. We took the easy one-hour round-trip boat from Lucerne to Kehrsiten-Burgenstock and back and had gorgeous views of Lucerne from the water and the beautiful wooded mountains that surround the lake. It's a big lake and we could easily have spent the entire day on a breathtaking leisurely ride around it happily hopping from town to town.",0,train
"Finnish history and naval history on an island where locals also live. A get away during summer for picnic. Also there is a small nice beach if you don’t mind the normally quite cold Baltic Sea water. Unfortunately the restaurants on the island don’t have the high standards of food compared to the best restaurants in Helsinki. You an also watch the big ferries going through the narrow Kustaanmiekka waterway, it’s really worth seeing.",1,train
"Maybe the greatest beach we personally have visited...  We loved everything about it.. The turquoise water, the clean sand, the calmness and closeness to Miami Art Deco...",1,train
Highly recommended if you're staying in Helsinki. A short boat trip away and you will get to see a stunning island with much history. Ferries are frequent and cheap.

First of all we were welcomed with tea and dates. Then taken to the elevator in a small group to start the fast journey to floor 148.  On arrival we were met with fresh juice and canapés and we purchased a photo pack and a couple of souvenirs. We stayed on floor 148 for about 30 minutes and then went down to floor 125.  There were more people on this level so we are glad we took photos on the higher floor.  We posted cards to our friends and watched the sunset.  I thought the kids may have been bored but we all enjoyed it.,1,train

The scenary is the best between Station 19 to 20 but was also the most difficult walk w steep steps.  We walked back to Station 14 and took the cable car down.

It took about 2 hours to hike up to the ""top"" (Tower 20), with the last section being particularly challenging -- but doable. Just imagining how this incredible wall was built hundreds of years ago is humbling.  Absolutely worth a visit -- bring some snacks and water.",1,train

"Definitely an amazing historical landmark that showcased the deep and rich culture of the Roman Empire and we recommend buying in advance skip the line tour passes in order to avoid the long ridiculous queue as on peak days they get about 100,000 visitors a day and that’s the cap limit capacity a day. Once that number is reached no one is allowed to go in and have to queue again the next day so best not waste time doing that especially if you’re on a strict holiday schedule with no extra days to spare.",1,train

Anything you could want or need can be found within the blocks of the old quarter, but do look around and haggle the prices as many shops do sell the same thing. Extra tip, I brought a compass, I found it was very easy to get lost, as many of the streets may seem the same and you can easily get turned around. The compass was a great help with keeping A sense of direction.",1,train

"There is NO way someone could travel to Dubai and not go see THE tallest building in the WORLD!! You can see this structure from every point in Dubai! It is also adjacent to the Dubai Mall and that is MASSIVE by itself!! The lines move fairly quickly to get to the elevators. Once you get to the elevators and get inside, don't get too comfy!! The elevators move from the 1st floor to the 125th floor IN 65 SECONDS!! And you don't feel a thing! When the door closes, the lighting goes to almost darkness and you start your ascent. There is a light show that shows you how fast you're moving and what elevation you are at that time. Pictures of the Empire State Building, Sears Tower, the Eiffel Tower go by and you're still rising! When you get to the ""top"" and the doors open up, you then realize how HIGH you are! You now look DOWN upon the rooftops of SKYSCRAPERS!! You can see for miles and the views are breath-taking! You will marvel at the absolute brilliance of the architecture and design. Photo ops are abound...There are some painted wings on the windows that everyone had to get a picture of. (Note: for best results, use a camera that have a strong flash. Daytime shots will only show the wings clearly and vividly but the person will be darkened due to the backlighting!) There are some very cool items to purchase in the gift shop and they are reasonably priced as well! Most of the items there can't be purchased anywhere else because of the ""At The Top""moniker..it's a pretty good marketing scheme! You can go one level down to the outdoor observation deck. When you step outside, you now feel the 40 mph winds whipping around you! The air was crisp and cool. No pollution to see or smell at that height and that was a great thing to witness. You could also see the Burj al Arab and our hotel, the Atlantis Palms...spectacular view! When you descend, the bottom floors shows photos and models of how this gargantuan of a structure came to be. To see the man who had this vision to build something so unreal is truly....unreal! We were there the last day before they had to restrict access due to COVID-19! I'm soooo glad that we made that trip!! So if you have a bucket list and you're in vacation mode, take a trip to Dubai and see one of the true wonders of the world! I promise you...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!  This place is truly awe-aspiring!",1,train

The people are warm and friendly, the countryside is beautiful and in the spring and summer there are flowers everywhere!  From July to September Strasbourg lights at least 3 different areas of the city each night.  There is a different them every year and the show is phenomenal.  If you plan to go on the weekend - -go EARLY.  Do not wait until it gets dark - you won't find parking.  In the summer it does not get dark in Strasbourg before 10:40pm or so.  The Cathedral is always one of the locations that is lit and you can easily walk there from Petite France.",0,train
"This was a perfect section, we went 9am - 4pm, longer than expected but ended up that way because its so stunning. The main towers near the cable car are obviously busy with tourists but you'll only need to walk a couple towers either side to get away from the groups, there's not much of a climb so perfect if you just want to walk casually. The further you walk the quieter it gets. Tower 19 to 20 is 400 steps and is a massive climb but well worth the view. Tower 6 has the luge or ski lift down. The luge is controlled by staff ensuring you go slow, if you want to go abit faster I recommend waiting until a queue has gone. We went up by cable car and walked to tower 20 then walked to tower 6 with a toilet stop at tower 15. Getting to the wall at the start you need to park at the ticket office then get the bus to the starting point. Locals complained of tour buses cramming the area so they set up this system instead, it worked really well. We had a really awesome tour guide sort everything out for us called Alvin Benton, totally recommend him. He knew so much and it made the experience so much more special and interesting. He then took us to a local dumpling restaurant afterwards which was excellent. We thought we didn't need a tour guide but his tips and stories made our day easier and memorable. He was so flexible and helpful, really lovely guy and great English. He's well worth the fee between 750-1050rmb depending on what you want. alvinbenton@yahoo.com",1,train

"This is such a beautiful part of the Great Wall.  Personally I feel it is more breathtaking than the Badaling section and less crowded.  The facilities at Mutianyu is good too with many restaurants and clean public bathroom facilities throughout the attraction (always bring toilet paper).  We hired a private car from drivers just outside of our hotel.  The return charge from Beijing to Mutianyu was RMB700 (RMB18 toll road charge each way is not included).  Once we reached the base of Mutianyu, the driver purchased the attraction tickets for us.  The tickets included the shuttle bus ride to the next level, then a cable car and entry to the wall.  For a family of 4 (2x students applies for the wall entry), all those tickets costed RMB680. The cable car ride is already RMB120 pp return, so if you are super fit, there’s a well paved track to the top of the wall.  Even with the cable car, there is still a 300-400m of fairly steep uphill walk and steps.  We left the hotel at 9:30am, got to the wall at 11:30am.  Including a quick lunch Mutianyu before visiting the wall, we left at 2pm and returned to Beijing around 4pm.  We went on Saturday in early January.",1,train

I've only rated it 4/5 as it was unclear which entrance to go in, there was no signs and we almost missed our guide as we just kept walking around and around.

Police presence means nothing. Besides this everyone was doing their own thing and enjoying the space.",0,train
"I am happy that we've decided to visit Burj Khaleefa tower which is one of the tallest tower of the world. It is worth spending time and money as the experience is for the life time. I booked the tickets through Klook two days ahead of the actual visit. It was a deal and I paid approximately around 8K for 2 adults and 1 kid (below 12 years) for the general admission At the top, 124/125th floor, in the morning slot. It is good to book ahead so that you get preferred entry slot. Also, Klook voucher is good enough to save some time and get the entry to the tour. You have to enter Burj via Dubai Mall. Overall it was a hassle free visit and we didn't face any issues or confusion. There are sufficient staff and security personnel to assist you in every step. There wasn't huge rush and the queue was moving fast. It was an exciting experience when you board the high speed lift which takes you to 125th Floor in just less than 30 seconds. The views from top were extraordinary and you can see the entire Dubai and it's beach line including the Palm Jumeirah islands. You can easily spend close to 2 hours enjoying the views from top in multiple directions in these 2 floors and can spend time in buying exclusive and high quality souvenirs. We bought few good souvenirs and a family photo. The cost of anything is on a higher side on these floors but it is the price you pay for the exclusivity :)  I am deducting one star due to the cost part of each and every item available in these floors. But overall, I would say it is a must visit and worth your time.",1,train
"The water is very clear and blue, the sand is white, it's beautiful. it was very crowded for me,  so I didn't stay long. restaurants and hotels are very close to the beach,  just across the ocean drive.",1,train

We stayed at the Old Quarter for almost a week and we did all our eating shopping sight seeing around the area. Highly recommend travellers to stay at the Old Quarter. (I travelled with my dad who is a senior),1,train
"After the ascent up there is no doubt that this is one of the special and breathtaking sights I have seen in the world (and I have seen a lot!) The height is undoubtedly one of the significant effects.  I was on the 124-15 floor- high enough and tangible.  Highly recommend doing the virtual reality attraction located on the 125th floor, and of course taking pictures with the wing paintings on the windows.  This is without a doubt a wonderful way to start your initial visit and impression of Dubai.  It is important to go up to the tower only on a day with good visibility otherwise it is a waste.",1,train
"Before you even get to the island, you have a 15 minute boat ride with stunning views from the Market Square. You can take a range of boats.  If you have any interest in history, you have to visit this UNESCO world heritage site. Very walkable with good shoes (beware it is slightly cobbled in places), this is a relatively compact gem. The main route from the quay to the Kings Gate at the bottom of the island is only 1.5 kilometres.  We went to the military museum - or rather the 3 parts of the museum, one of which is the submarine. Excellent displays and they shed some light on the historical relationship Finland has had with its neighbours and the rest of Europe. This is the centenary of the Finnish Defence Forces and that part of the museum was equally illuminating.  We stopped for a light bite in another museum cafe before wandering down to the Kings Gate, back up past the artillery pieces on the sea wall. Looking at the Powder Magazine, we were politely shooed away as there was a wedding party talking place - a great and romantic location!  The Customs museum is definitely worth a visit - interesting as well as free - and there is an exhibition on detection dogs at the moment.  We stopped for a beer and tea at another of the many cafes on the site after visiting the dry dock and the main square.  A slight wait (15 mins) for the ferry back but it was an excellent day out, compounded by the glorious sunshine.  Many visitors had brought a picnic and were on the grass, beach and rocks. Next time I will borrow that idea!",1,train

"Although this is rated as one of the best attractions to visit in Istanbul, I was very underwhelmed by the Hagia Sophia. The history of the building changing between religions is interesting, however the upkeep of the building is not the best. The architecture on the outside is impressive but it is very dark and gloomy on the inside. If you are looking for beautiful interiors, I recommend going to some of the other mosques in Istanbul such as the Suleymaniye Mosque which is incredible.",1,train

"I can’t say enough about this place in the middle of Strasbourg, France. We went there to take a 2 hour walking tour of the Christmas markets in November. We walked and walked and learned about the history of this place while learning the different locations of the Christmas markets there (I lost count of how many as one ran into another). When the tour was over, we got a chance to explore but not enough time to go back to all of them again. Maybe next year I will return and see more of the markets and of Strasbourg. The people were lovely, the place diverse and welcoming, and walkable. We took tram to close by the market. It was a fun night but you really need at least 2 days there to explore in day and at markets. All I can say is WOW!",0,train
"My best experience with this is the elevator rides.  The 125th floor is all indoor while the 124th floor has some outdoor open air.  Did not enjoy the views from top: may be due to hazy air, or may be too much constructions.  Perhaps it might look better at night with all buildings lite",1,train
"We walked 3 miles along the trail that runs parallel to Lake Lucerne—the trail is nicely paved and very peaceful.  The trees and landscaping are all nicely manicured and you will run into interesting art sculptures, along with real-life swans and ducks along the edge of the lake.    We also went on a 60-minute Lake Lucerne Sightseeing Cruise from Pier 7.  They have reasonable prices and offer comfortable seating aboard a pretty yacht.  You can opt to wear an ear piece for audio narration (available in a variety of languages) as you coast and take in the beautiful views of the mountains and homes of Lake Lucerne.    ***A Bit of Advice:  If you’re going in the late-afternoon or evening, bring a jacket or a blanket to keep warm if you’re sitting in the open-air areas of the yacht that cruises through beautiful Lake Luzern.",1,train

I was not aware how important the canals and the movement of water was to inland towns and villages in the north of France.  Industry and transportation was key to these towns.  La Petite France takes you back in time to their reliance on these things.  I highly recommend that you go mid-day or later to avoid the Canal cruise crowds.  We were in the middle of them so we spent our time 'hiding out' from the throngs of people following 'Viking' signs here and there.,0,train

Get online and study their timetables and buy yourself an advance ticket.  We had a daily ""early bird"" ticket bought online, which gave us unlimited travel on any of the boats all day.  Unfortunately, it was very wet when we were there so we just did Vitznau to Lucerne return, with a little bit of sightseeing in Lucerne, which is a good choice in the rain because of the covered bridges.  In the evening we travelled from Vitznau to Weggis by boat for a meal.  The boats are very reliable and are timed to meet up with cable cars, trains and other local transport. You miss out big time if all you see is the city of Lucerne and then have a round trip on the lake. Places such as Weggis and Brunnen are well worth visiting.",1,train

"Our trip to Rome was very impromptu so I did my planning in the car on the way from Tuscany. We booked the day before we went and had an idea that we’d want to get there early to avoid the worst of the heat (remember this was August). We arrived 45 minutes before it opened and the line was already 30 people long. My first criticism is that no one was sure where to line up, there were no signs and no clear place to go if you had booked a ticket or needed to book a ticket. There ended up being two long snaking lines of people really not sure which line they had to be in and switching lines when they heard someone say they might be in the wrong line. Going inside felt like a bit of a free for all as you were let in and then everyone just kind of rushed forward not really knowing what they were looking for or where they needed to be but wanting to be the first to get there. There is a museum type setup on the inside which is really interesting and shows small models of the colosseum, statues they found, mosaics partly destroyed and stone work recreated. We paid extra for the headset with the tour, although we went the wrong way so it wasn’t relevant to anything we were looking at but was still interesting and informative. It was super busy, but then it was August so I did expect the crowds. What I didn’t expect was all the litter that was left around and even cigarette ends just thrown on the floor. I liked the fact you could move from the inside to the outside at intervals so you could be out of the scorching sun and have a bit of a rest. In my head I’d imagined that you could walk on the ground area (where mock battles and fights would have been) but there was work going out so it looked more like an archeological dig rather that a sand area like it though it would. You could pay extra and stand on the lower lever, something we didn’t pay extra for. All that being said, you can’t help but be awed at the sheer sight and scale of the colosseum or the history that goes along with it. I would go again but not I’m August and with more research!",1,train

"Mutianyu is a great place to experience the fantastic Great Wall of China. The entrance is very close to the bus station and car park. There’s a supermarket and cafe here too. From there It’s a long and steep steeped walk up to the wall, but well worth it. There is a cable car and a chairlift as alternate modes of transport, also a toboggan for coming back down. There are a couple of refreshment stalls when you get up to the wall. The views even on a smoggy day were amazing, and when the sky did clear it became very chilly. Parts of the wall itself are also very steep, and there are forts to explore as you wander along enjoying the spectacle. It wasn’t too crowded on the day we went, and you can see why it’s the number one thing to do in China. An essential experience.",1,train

"The Ferry over is 2.90 euros and is short—approximately 20 minutes. In March not many on ferry and island so literally had the place to ourselves. Museum closes at 4:30 on island, and there are many little cute cafes and coffee shops. The fortress is really cool to see and it’s a great walk for viewing the Baltic and the ocean liners leaving for their journeys. Overall, nice inexpensive 2 hour excursion when it’s all done.",0,train
"We got here with Mubus from Beijing (see other reviews) arriving at around 2pm. We opted for just the entrance tickets (40RMB per person) as the add-ons like the cable car were far more expensive (+120RMB pp). My girlfriend did do the chairlift up and toboggan/slide down (previous year) which she said was worth it however. As we were part of a tour, the guide handled tickets and we got a free lift to the entrance (the ticket office and actual entrance are some distance a part and you have to get a shuttle at 15RMB pp to get there otherwise). We were recommend to take the path up to tower 10 and proceed from there. The walk up to tower 10 from the Great Wall entrance is tough and certainly the cable car is suggested for anyone who struggles with moderate exercise. The walk up took roughly 20 minutes. We went on a clear day (we waited to book our tour until we were certain of the weather conditions) and the 40RMB plus 20 minute walk was absolutely worth it when you arrive at Tower 10 and take in the view. From Tower 10 we walked all the way to Tower 20 (the last accessible tower) taking as many photos as possible along the way; there was certainly no shortage of scenic photo opportunities. The wall is well maintained and there is a good balance between necessities (e.g. bins) and shops, and keeping a natural vibe; it didn't seem touristy at all and felt like genuinely scaling an ancient wall. The walking conditions, of course, are sketchy, but this only adds to the experience (note: wear appropriate footwear!). The climb to Tower 20 is not for the faint hearted, but again the view was well and truly worth it. The walk from Tower 10 to Tower 20 took roughly 1 hour 30 minutes with photo stops a long the way. Not stopping on the way back makes it quicker, and then we descended via the same route from Tower 10. Despite being a world renowned attraction, it did not feel busy at all, possibly as the afternoon, we were told, is less crowded. In conclusion, this experience of China, to date, has been my personal favourite. I truly reccomend a visit, not just to 'tick-off' another famous site, but because it is genuinely awe inspiring.",1,train

Total travel time was 2-2.5 hours because of road traffic. there is a bus from Huai Bei Da Jie but it takes ages, just get a cab it's not that expensive. it's on the other side of the road, the cab drivers usually shout you other which could put you off but don't let it, they are fine, just trying to earn a living. we went on a Wednesday and arrived at the wall at around midday and there was not that many people. there is a cable car or you can walk. the location is amazing. enjoy",0,train

"Mutianyu Great Wall Beijing  A terrific way to get to the best part of the Great Wall from the airport is by local, public bus (not tour bus/private car/organised tour) Take the airport express from the airport to Dongzhimen station. It is about half an hour; the ticket price is 25RMB. Take 916 express (make sure it's the EXPRESS) - go to Huairoubeidajie station, transfer H23 or quick cab ride to Mutianyu.  Or get the bus all the way up, & head to tower 14, then just keep climbing. You can go all the way to the top. It's hard, but soooooo worthwhile. There's not much food, and it's quite arduous, so take food with you or you can get to bargain for water, fruit and snacks on the way up, if you forget. I even had large portions of the wall all to myself, sometimes for several minutes. And there are drink sellers right near the top - hardy souls, I think they deserve patronage. Such an achievement to climb so high, you feel like you are on top of the world.  If you have time to visit Shanghai, aside from my favourite restaurant - Mr and Mrs Bund - there are two other hard-to-find places you should visit - the well-hidden propaganda poster museum and the Former Provisional Government Site of the Republic of Korea (a bit like a poor man's Churchill War Cabinet rooms in London)",1,train

"The nice thing about Suomenlinna is that it offers a wide range of things to see. It is small enough that you can cover many of the attractions in a day or even half a day, but big enough that you can still find some solitude if you venture off the beaten path a bit. There is a few museums covering different aspects of life on the fortress, with a definite emphasis on the military aspect of things (as can be expected for a fortress).  None of the museums by itself is very large and spectacular, but today they weave an interesting story.  There are nice cafes, and a church (which is more interesting viewed from the outside).  There are certainly many places for great photos.  The place can get crowded particularly on the weekends, we went on the first ferry in mid May and managed to beat the crowds - unfortunately it was also pretty chilly and most attractions were not open until 10.  So check the opening hours and the ferry schedules before you go.",1,train
"Okay.. Not seeing the Collosseum in Rome is like not eating pasta in Italy. This one of the 7th worldwonders is very impressive on the outside. If we stuck our head outside of the window of our suite we could see it. In the evening the lights are even more beautiful. The idea that so many years such games where held here is mind blowing (tip: what the movie Gladiator before visiting it..) but or my imagination is much greater or the staff of the Collosseum didn't met my expectations. The ruines are impressive.. but that is all there is.. Tickets for adults are 20 euro's and besides the ruines there are only card board pictures from it and one digital screen. I would put some full dressed Gladiators there or stuffed tigers or lions. So in my opinion, stay on the outside and save your money for a great italian dish and a nice bottle of wine. If you check Google maps you can see directly in the Collosseum too. Tip: kids are cheap visitors; only 2 euro per person. And.. this is one disappointment which I have since my childhood; why can nobody explain how they flooded the place and did ship battles here? It is incredible but even the guides couldn't explain it to me. I was so hoping to get more inside information on that. Besides all of this; Is is a must-see when visiting Rome.",0,train

We were told to come 15 minutes earlier, so we did. But then we waited for 25 minutes to be allowed to go in. There were only six of us and it was raining. All this time the security people just watched us getting wet from under the roof. Nobody even thought to offer us to get inside from the rain. They took us to the arena area without any word or explanation what to do or what to expect. We were allowed only to be on one half of the arena for ten minutes. Again, no explanation. Then they took us to another small area with a cross and that was it! After that we went to the other parts of Colosseum. I still don't know what was the point!",1,train

"Fascinating history here linking to the history of Finland itself.  We went on a guided tour where the guide gave us a great deal of the history - to be recommended if you can. The fortress is well-worth visiting, only a short ferry ride from Helsinki.  Although Suomenlinna translates as 'Castle of Finland', it is not a castle, but a military fortress with barracks, built over six islands from 1748 by the Swedes.  The islands have an area of 80 hectares, the fortification walls were about 8 km long and the fortress had space for 1000 cannon.  The fortress was not a great success. It surrended to the Russians in 1808 during the War of Finland (because the Swedes could not reach it through the Baltic ice) and remained a Russian garrison for 110 years.  There is still a military academy here, with a sauna for 200 soldiers - the largest in the world.  About 800 people live here (there is a 10 year waiting list to apply), the prison still has around occupants who spend time repairing the historic walls, and the fortress has the oldest dry dock still in use in the world. The church was built by the Russians in 1854, originally as an Orthodox church, but is now Lutheran and was 'simplified' after Finnish independence. In the Finnish Civil War in 1918, the fortress housed 8000 political prisoners.  It was first opened to the public during the 1952 Olympics and fully opened 20 years later.",1,train

"Beautiful large square in Venice famous all over the world with its monuments such as the Doge's Palace, the Basilica, the bell tower, the clock tower, etc .; and surrounded by various expensive restaurants, bars and shops.",1,train
"The square is dominated at its eastern end by St Mark's basilica. The west facade of the basilica consists of great arches and marble decoration , Romanesque carvings round the central doorway.  Piazzetta San Giovanni XXIII is an open space on the north side of the basilica.  The  neo- classic building on the east side adjoining the Basilica is the Palazzo Patriarcale ,the seat of the Patriarch of Venice. Beyond that is the Clock Tower, above a high archway where the street Merceria leads through shopping streets to the Rialto, the commercial and financial centre. To the right of the clock tower is the closed church of San Basso. To the left is the long arcade along the north side of the Piazza, the buildings on this side are known as the Procuratie Vecchie, formerly homes and offices of high state officers in the days of the republic of Venice. Nowadays the arcade is lined with shops and restaurants at the ground level with offices above.  Turning left at the end , the arcade continues along the west end of the Piazza  to the entrance of the Museo Correr. Turning lef again, the arcade continues down the south side of the Piazza. The buildings on this side are the new procuracies. The ground floor has shops and also the famous cafe, Caffe Florian. Opposite to this, standing free in the Piazza is the Campanile of St Mark's basilica. Adjacent to the Campanile , facing towards the church is the elegant small building, Loggetta del Sansovino, and used as a lobby by patricians waiting to go into a meeting of the Great Council in the Doge's Palace. Across the Piazza in front of the church are three large mast like flagpoles  with bronze bases decorated in high relief. The Venetian flag of St Mark  flies together with the Italian flag.",1,train

"Dubai has always been one of my favourite cities to visit in the UAE, and this is for many different reasons. However, one of the main reasons is The Dubai Mall which is located in the heart of the prestigious Downtown Dubai. It is the most visited retail and entertainment destination, which welcomes more than 80 million visitors annually.        The Dubai Mall is the world’s largest shopping mall and it is most famous for its huge range of stores and it’s high class service. The Dubai Mall also features the world-class Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo, which are two wonderful places to visit with your family. The Mall also leads to the Dubai Fountain at the Burj Khalifa lake. This is an amazing display of waterworks that leaves people breathless.    In my opinion, nothing can top my experience at the Dubai Mall. Although the place was very crowded, I really enjoyed every moment I spent at the Dubai Mall.

Even though there is a gondola to take you to the base of the wall, from where the shuttle drops you off, the road to the gondola requires a walk up a steep incline and is very difficult for someone with limited mobility. There was someone with a motorized cart that will transport people up to the gondola for a fee, but he is an independent business and we did not see any other means of assistance. We had two members in our party with limited mobility and assumed that the gondola would address their needs.

"St Marks Square is the famous hub of Venice housing both St Marks Basilica and Doge's Palace. I think the best thing about Piazza San Marco is the fact that every way you turn, there is a historical attraction. The square itself gives impressive views of both from its centre, and offers the opportunity to ascend the campanile and get a view right across the city. The tourist hub of the city, it will undoubtedly be packed with people whenever you go, except at certain times of the year where the square has been known to be susceptible to floods being so close to the Adriatic sea. Around the square you will find the most high class shops in the city. All the most famous names are there with some genuinely high class items available but at a price fitting with an Italian tourist hotspot. The restaurants are much the same with some beautiful places but with higher prices than you will in other parts of Venice (although you are often accompanied by music while you dine, for a small surcharge in some cases).

About and hours drive out of central Beijing with easy parking at the visitor centre at the foot of the hills.  You can either walk up the 800+ steps to get to the wall or do what we did and get the cable car.

Not the easiest walking on the wall with several steep sections but take your time and enjoy it.  Weather was clear and mild in early November and not overcrowded,1,train

An imperial Free City during the Reformation, Strasbourg's embracing of the Reformation made it a magnet for refugees and reformers alike. My personal quest was to find the church where Reformer John Calvin pastored a group of French expats. I found it, but it's no longer a church. A plaque notes its historical significance, and while that was a bit disappointing, it was still cool to find and identify. We visited lots of little shops, eating outside of a simple little local bread/sandwich shop with a mother and daughter from Australia. Walking around, we tried some bakeries, and then found a confectioner's with excellent macaroons. Just a great time, and so absolutely worth visiting!",0,train

At last a sunny day enabled us to go on a 5 and a half hour cruise around Lake Lucerne. We had done this 14 years ago and it still looks beautiful. The boat stops at all the stops around the Lake. We had hot chocolate and lunch and tea and cake in those hours. ! There were lots of passengers using the boat as a commute and lots of tourists as well. Service was good. This is the only gripe I have...the day before we asked about whether I could take my mobility scooter on board and the man said yes and there were no complications with toilets and so on. So the next day we went to buy the tickets and board when another ticket seller said it would cost 24CHF to take the scooter on board and no there was nowhere to leave it safely by the ticket booth. I and my friends were outraged  as there had been no mention of this the day before. It was a good job I had the money on me.All this aside it is a trip so well worth doing especially if the sun is shining  !,0,train

"In August of 2019 we spent a week in Old Istanbul and visited several famous historical sites, one of which was the Ayasofya Museum/Church/Mosque.We were staying at the Yasmak Sultan Hotel and they arranged for a walking tour guide to take us to several historical sites. We paid that guide a 100 Euros for the day and it was well worth the price. We were one on one with the guide, he was personable, educated and incredibly knowledgeable.The cost for going into the Ayasofya was 144 Turkish lira for the 2 of us. The Ayasofya Church was built was built from 530AD to 535AD by 10,000 laborers,it is all brick and mortar, no steel in the structure. It was a Greek Orthodox church for 1000 years and when the Turks conquered the area it was turned into a Mosque for 400 years. For the last 80 plus years it has been a Museum honoring both the Church and the Mosque. I am not a very religious person but when you walk into the Ayasofya there is definitely a feeling that you are in a very special place, The structure itself is enormous and a tribute to what mankind was capable of building by hand over1500 years ago.The always ongoing restoration of the Ayasofya is in itself a labour of love and a labour of historical art preservation of both the Christian and Muslim religions under the same roof. ll spent.

We were a bit worried about the sub-zero temperature, but with the bright sunshine and the walking, we actually felt quite warm. Do reserve some time for the Mutiyanyu village.

You have the option to climb up to the wall via stairs or ride a cable-car for a fee. Climbing up is a great experience I highly recommend, but it is indeed very tiring. This is one thing you must consider. It was winter when I visited, with temperatures less than 5 degrees celsius, but I ended up sweaty when I arrived at the wall! Don't regret it, though!  Going down you also have the option to walk, ride the cable car, or whiz down by toboggan slide. I chose to ride the slide, which was a bit expensive, but was very, very thrilling. The views while riding were amazing, and although the speed is a bit fast, you would never feel unsafe. If you can, ride the slide! I believe it's only available at the Mutianyu Great Wall!",1,train

"The picturesque areas of La Petite France are between the 2 bridges Pont Faisan and Pont St. Martin and probably center around Place Benjamin Zix where the House of Tannners, now a restaurant, is located. This area is a tourist magnet. The 16th and 17th century half-timbered 4 story row houses that line the narrow lanes and the waterway provide an ambience of yesteryear without the smells of open sewer ditches and the noise of tanneries and water mills. The multilingual illustrated boards around Place Benjamin Zix inform visitors about the industry and past living conditions of this area. The spice, grain, and water mills and bathing houses have vanished from the ""3 fingers"" of land in the RIver Ill channels, but the houses have been renovated and still are used for shops, restaurants at the ground level. From Place Benjamin Zix there is a pedestrian footbridge over the canal from where excellent photos and views of these houses lining the canal can be taken.  One would think this area could be called ""Little Venice"" instead of ""La Petite France"", a name used in the past for this area because of its hospital to treat French soldiers with syphilis. The area is also referred to as ""tanners' district"". Tanners who lived in these houses used the upper stories to dry their animal skins, often hanging them out from those upper windows. They had their own pub across from the House of Tanners.  Crowds will thin out around Pont Couverts where the 3 towers and Barrage Vauban are located. While Rue de Moulins provides distant views of the 3 towers on Pont Couverts, it is better to actually walk along Pont Couverts to see the Barrage Vauhan. It's only a 5 minute walk from Place Benjamin Zix to Pont Couverts using Pont Faisan and Quais de la Petite France, one of the ""fingers"". However, the best photo of those 3 towers on Pont Couverts, once part of the medieval fortifications, is from the roof of the Barrage Vauban, another 7 minute walk.  Rue des Dentelles also connects Pont St. Martin with Pont Faisan. This narrow pedestrian lane has guild flags hanging from the buildings and many restaurants, but it is not particularly picturesque. Walk 10 minutes along this winding lane to finally reach the Cathedral Notre Dame.  We walked a circular route in La Petite France which took about 30-45 minutes. This area is a ""must see"" as it is so charming with its well preserved half-timbered 16th and 17th century houses along the waterway. We took many post-card type pictures.",1,train
"Loud screaming late at night, smell of weed is a constant, large groups of people blocking the the sidewalk and traffic being held up until people in the car purchased their weed. Those arev some of things you will have to deal with if you come to South Beach.  We had to move 3 times while at the beach to get away from the strong skunky smell of weed and the constant din of gangster rap music. I can't believe how things have changed in South Beach. I used to love coming here but not anymore.  Be very careful if you're traveling a long way to get here because it is not worth it.",0,train
"With the basilica at the top of the square and its huge bell tower then surrounded on three sides by this wonderful architecture, you just need to stand in the middle to get the feel of this once proud empire of Venice.

"La Petite France or Little France has a thousand words in it’s beauty. If you lovemaking  beautiful picturesque than bring along a good camera since you’re talented and you’ll not miss a thing here. Strasbourg has plenty of beautiful sites and La Petite is sure to please artists. I wish I could just sit at one corner bridges and sketch them all. France is blessed with many beautiful sites and every cities has a different story. Strasbourg is just a border city from Offenburg and not far from Switzerland and Liechtenstein so you’ll get to see mostly local tourists. While on the long bridge just don’t let anyone rushes you. Stand right in middle of La Petite bridges and get the best pictures from left to right where the centuries old Chatéau sits on the Rhine River before your eyes. Than take a walk to the end bridge that takes you through the pretty villages along Rhine and you’ll find for more. You could sit at La Conde â Lindge a Cafe under big trees next to Rhine River and appreciate the manifique views. This places has great energy with the rivers currents running loudly and sorts of characters within the community. There’s one begging with an honest placard asking €1 for alcohol. You don’t find that many in France and some find their home under the centuries old solid metal bridges. The pretty florals arrangement along the bridges is typically French as same with their homes. Walking further you’ll find surprises, the Place De La Cathédrale another manifique piece of art.",1,train

"I had never heard of Petite France until we went on a walking tour in the area. It is a beautiful part of the city, and you immediately feel like you have stepped back in time. Strasbourg has lots of history, and has changed hands over the centuries to be German, then French, then German and back again. Because of this, you have German and French influences all throughout Strasbourg, reflected in the street names, architecture and food. Petite France has saved its French influence in all of these areas. You can take a boat trip along the river, you can eat and enjoy the ambiance, and shop or just take pictures and marvel at the charming and relaxing atmosphere.",1,train
"I like the place, the church is so nice, full of paintings and its like a museum. However, a long queue to get into the church.

This May we visited Lucerne and with us was one adventurous guy who decided to rent a motor boat for the 5 of us! I would never have thought of doing that but 3 of them were young and up for experiences. So happy he did rent it because it was terrific! I was a little nervous but the views from the lake looking back at the shore line were beautiful. I took several photos of 2 of the daring ones standing for their blog site. Really fun time you should try! Rental site is easy to find near crossover bridge.,1,train
Beautiful clean public beach.  Lifeguards during the day which is needed because when I arrived the winds were so strong it was surfer weather not for weak swimmers or children.

"A must see if your visiting Helsinki. Lovely island with a lot of interesting history. Easy to get to with the HSL ferry (public transportation ferry that goes often in the summer). Sveaborg is suitable for kids as well. Recommend the guided tour. As I said it's a lot of history on this island and you won't get it all by just walking around on your own. Especially not the funny anecdotes the guide told us. Finished my visit with a lovely lunch at Bastion. There ""maltbröd"" (bread) that came with the soup was beyond delicious. Take your time on these islands, you'll need it and it's worth it.",1,train

"I last visited Lucerne eight years ago as a child. My memories of that visit centred around the Chapel Bridge, Lion Monument and Old Town. But when I visited in mid Sep of 2019, I couldn't believe that I had missed on what was perhaps the grandest draw of Lucerne: its stunning lake.  Its clear blue waters flanked by green-topped mountains makes for many good photo opportunities. I'm especially partial to having photos taken of Mount Pilatus, brown instead of green but with a pointed and even shape, lending it a majestic air. We took a boat cruise out onto the lake to get even closer views - I felt it was worth the 20 odd francs per pax. The only caveat to all this is that the sun should be out and the day roughly clear, because the water best reflects the sunlight this way.",1,train

"This portion of the wall was relatively easy to get to (joined a small group tour by Trippest)  and not too bad to get to the wall itself. There is a short uphill climb to get to the cable car, which I used. Going to the top on foot didn't look as hard as I expected, but time is also a consideration. Once at the top you have the choice of continuing up or down the wall, but there are also up and down areas including steps all along each segment between towers. The views were amazing all along this portion. If you can make it up to the cable car, you can enjoy large portions of this wall no matter what your physical limitations are. The active people, in the tour group I was with, made it to the top tower allowable, and back, in less time than we were given, the rest did what they could or wanted to do. It really didn't matter as the views were great from the very first tower. Loved this location!",1,train

I wanted to just see the Coliseum from the inside so I purchased the 11.5 euros ticket at the official website. The ticket says is valid in for the Coliseum visit (not the Forum) and only for PM time visits. So I purchased the ticket and booked my entrance time also online. On arrival I was told the ticket is only valid for me to wonder around the ground floor level (arena level) of the coliseum and I was not allowed to go to the upper levels. The staff mentioned this happens everyday and suggested going to a governmental office to file a complain There is no information about this when you purchase the ticket so it's absolutely misleading and frustrating experience If you wish to go to the upper levels then purchase the full ticket which will also give you access to the Forum,1,train

Differences, now no entrance fee, but you can no longer go in with your wife/partner, unless you are same sex. There are men's and women’s separate entrances and sections and adherence is closely monitored. The men’s being three times larger than the women's. The fresco of the Virgin Mary as you enter has been obscured by a large white obstruction like a drop down cinema screen. And whereas as a museum you could enter at any time via a ticket, it is now strictly controlled around prayer and other times. Also quite correctly remove shoes for all and women's heads, shoulders and legs to below the knee must be covered.

Later, in 15th century,  under the Ottoman empire, transitioned into an imperial mosque and functioned that way for c. 400+ yrs. And now a museum. Amazing ! How historical can a monument be !!

You can go up in 3 ways - climb 1300 steps (with 2 paths, each reaching a different guard house), cable car and gondola (ski/chair lift). Would recommend climbing up as the forested steps are a fantastic experience - can be done by first time/not-so-fit trekkers (like me) although you may need several breaks (also like me). While coming down, we chose the chair lift although the toboggan ride is a popular and fun option. Get here first thing in the morning to avoid crowds.

Saw plenty of locals just sitting on the rocks watching the waves come and go, of sitting on the grass in a circle and taking to each other.

Spend about half a day in the island and, If I didn't have to return to the ferry, I would have spent a lot more.",1,train
"The trip to the Burj Khalifa was fun, but I will say that they need to do a better job of organizing the exit point once you're ready to go back down.  I ended up having a bit of an argument with a man who worked there when I asked where the exit was.  He pointed, I followed and we ended up at the entrance and when I came back and asked him why he sent me there he simply looked at me with no answer.  In the end, we found the exit through the gift shop which was quite a chaotic scene, but we made it out.What I did like is that we booked lunch and the VR experience as part of a package deal.  The VR simply blew our minds and was exhilarating and fun.The lunch was quite delicious and we had an excellent table overlooking the fountains.Quite honestly, if it hadn't been for that one employee or the chaotic exit, this would have been a perfect experience, but all in all; I would completely recommend this.",1,train

Fantastic photo opportunities from the top of the covered bridge - with the majesty of the cathedral in the background.  Well work at least a couple of hours to browse around.  Some well-reviewed restaurants in the area...we did not eat here as trusted locals advised us that prices are inflated as it is a very touristy part of the city.  Consider going slightly further afield for better quality food at more reasonable rates.  Enjoy your visit!",1,train

We were so mesmerized by the picturesque historic quarter we came many times at different times of the day. The fact we just stayed across the river helped.  The old half-timbered houses were previously occupied by leather tanners hence the name Le Tanneries. Who would have thought the stinky place would one day be a major tourist attraction for Strasbourg.  We really loved this place.",1,train

"We arrived in Venice in the evening, and our hotel was just off the main square. I was genuinely gobsmacked and in awe of the beauty of this square. The Basilica San Marco at one end of the square in all its ornate glory, with the other buildings sophistically lit up with simple white lights giving it such a wonderful atmosphere. The restaurants around the square had small stages with live classical music being played to be enjoyed by customers and passers by. I was so glad our hotel was just off this square so I had the pleasure to enjoy it ever day. It is also a very good location to use as a base in the sense that a lot of the interesting things to see are near here. however there is lots to see throughout. The restaurants on the square were a bit more expensive than else where as you can expect (prices do tend to go up when they are in good locations) however me and my boyfriend only actually notices the price of a main meal drop by a few euros away from the square. In the day time there are a lot of tourists, and with the Basilica San Marco and Doge Palace being on the square, there were often long queue making it a busy place to be (I will be writing another review of the Bascilica San Marco, where I also explain how to avoid the queues). Venice is prone to some flooding at high tides. Throughout the city there were walkways stacked up ready to be used. On one morning we came out of the hotel to find large puddles on the Square, there had obviously been a high tide and we were seeing the residual water, but there was no effect on what we could do, however if we came out earlier when the water was at high tide then there may have been some changes to plans, but from what we could see they are very well equipped and prepared for this. The only negative thins I have to say about the square is that there were men selling light up flying cheap toys, which ruined the atmosphere slightly. Also there were men who would target people (mostly people who looked like couples) with roses, looking like they are giving you roses then making you pay after. It was a bit of a pain when walking through, seeing men making a beeline for you, but mostly just saying no would deter them. Only once did we need to say more than this to make the man leave us alone, he kept saying ""I'm going home soon"" funnily enough we saw the same guy a couple hours later, apparently he had not gone home and he did the same to us again.These people are minor nuisances. However one evening there was a man following us, I assume to try and pick pocket us, but luckily my boyfriend noticed and we stopped by a restaurant making it obvious we knew what he was doing and he left. This was the only negative thing that stood out in our whole trip with regards to safety. But I would also like to point out that there is a strong military presence in the city due to there being a base near by and on multiple occasions we saw a police officer with 2 military people escorting them too.",1,train
We were there at the Lake for few hours. Great City of Lucerne is having beautiful lake within the city. It was a pleasure to roam there and had a close look to beautiful lake. The busy street adjacent to lake is having good shopping. It is highly recommended to visit marvelous chapel Bridge on the lake.,0,train
"We visited this place on a hot day when the whole area was very crowded. We sat down for a few minutes on some steps but were quickly told by a jobs-worth that sitting down in the square is forbidden. There are no public seats anywhere, only those belonging to cafes where you are, not unreasonably, expected to pay extortionate prices for coffee.  The buildings are marvellous but the city authorities are determined that it is impossible to enjoy them. We have seen Venice, but will definitely not be returning.",0,train

"For me this was a bucket list thing.   There are several different parts of the Great Wall that you can visit.  It’s about 2 hours from Beijing.  We used a tour guide to get us there so this made it much easier to navigate and know the tips and tricks.  We rode the ski lift up, climbed the wall to a few towers and took some great pictures.   We were told this part is restored so easier to climb than other parts.   Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk, climb and rest.  The unique thing about this part of the Mutianyu Great Wall is the ski lift chair and tobagan down.  You can ride solo or tandem on the tobagan.   It’s easily to navigate and was super fun although I wish it wasn’t so busy so we could have rode it down much faster.    You can’t stop or take pictures while on the tobagan but there are ways to do it.   They also have a person talking a souvenir photo that you can purchase for about $5.  Such a great experience!  There’s souvenir stores and food at the bottom of the wall before you start although it’s very pricey.",1,train

Unfortunately we were too early as the museums were not opened for another couple of hours.( Check the opening times)  So we decided to walk around to kings gate. Lovely short walk, pass the dry dock and a cafe in the park if you want a drink. Plenty of toilets scattered around. Some spots people were paddling in the sea. It looked like you could probably walk the coastline around the whole of the island.( Lots of steps involved). At kings gate there were cannons and some short tunnels.  TOP TIP - take a Torch, especially if you are wearing sunglasses like me. I did not have my normal gasses with me and so it was pitch black and could not go in.

"A truly amazing neighbourhood.  We stayed here, amongst the hustle and bustle, and loved every minute of it.  Be prepared for:  horns, thousands of bikes, cars rushing past you, footpaths crowded with bikes, streetfood, shopwares, people, smells, sights and sounds.  There are some really cute little shops with wonderful things to take home for youself and family, great coffee can be found everywhere, food is on every corner, and also the most magnificent flowers in roadside florists.Walking the streets can be a little hair raising, as the footpaths are virtually impossible to walk on so you do have to share the road as a pedestrian, dodging bikes, people and cars.  But, you do soon get used to it, and find ways to more confidently cross the streets.  The night markets on the weekends are great to visit (and chaotic of course).  One of the best experiences we had was doing a one hour cyclo tour through the area - it was lovely because you didn't have to concentrate on where you were walking, and could just enjoy the beautiful architecutre and sights.I don't think you have experience Hanoi unless you have spent time exploring the Old Quarter - highly recommended.",1,train
"We were told by several locals that this is the best section of the great wall, and we are so glad we visited it. We went on a perfect slightly sunny day in June, and it was not overly crowded with tourists at all, but actually quite peaceful. We asked the concierge of our hotel in Beijing to book us a driver for the day, which worked perfectly. He picked us up at our hotel, drove us to the great wall which was about an hour drive, and picked us up after spending about three hours, and drove us back to Beijing. We took the cable car up and down, as we were not into climbing that many steps, but there were people who did it and said it was great. The ski lift and toboggan on a different part of the wall also sounded fun and were highly recommended. Once at the top, we spent about an hour and a half hiking around the wall. We certainly could have spent longer if we had more time and energy, so plan your trip accordingly. The views were gorgeous and it was definitely an amazing bucket list adventure. It’s so fascinating how sticky rice was used in the mortar for the bricks. While this is not the closest section of the wall to Beijing, I think it’s worth the extra bit of driving as it is so scenic and definitely less crowded. Beware of the souvenir sellers at the bottom who will definitely try hard to sell you their goods, though it can be fun to bargain them down. It’s definitely advisable to use the bathrooms at the bottom of the wall, as there are noneonce you get up to a certain point. We bought our tickets at the wall and it was no problem. This is a must do if you are in the Beijing area.",1,train

Don't buy your tickets for the Colosseum from the Colosseum, but rather from the Palatine Hill entrance (on the Via de San Gregorio) where there are no queues.  We were so glad we had tickets because as we got nearer to the Colosseum there were literally hundreds of people queuing.We combined our visit with the audio-video guide.  I wouldn't say it was a must, but I think it enhanced our visit and gave the tour some structure.

"I arrived  at the wall just after 0900 and there were not too many people so it was a breeze to buy tickets, get straight on the cable car to the top and traverse the wall. In my opinion the best route is when you get to the Wall proper turn right and keep walking until you can't go any further that will take you to tower 20. Be aware you will climb some very steep stairways but it is worth it. As I was leaving the Wall a couple of hours later the crowds were insane you could barely move and the fun-factor would be zero so the best advice I can offer is to go as early as possible,",0,train

It's a huge Piazza, the buildings are impressive as is the Church which you can tour. BUT...make sure you're not planning to eat while you're there. We did find a spot that sold reasonably priced ice cream, but when we sat down at one of the patio areas, we were immediately given the boot. Wait Staff Serviced Area ONLY we were shouted at. Fine. We got up and went inside to a secluded area out of sight and sat down. The same guy spotted us and said the same thing. Okay. We just walked while finishing our treat. While walking I noticed one cafe was offering coffee. The price? 22 Euros for 2 cups! As we kept walking I was eyeing the menus that were placed outside of the various establishments. About 3 times what we had been paying during our trip of Italy.There are plenty of reasonably priced restaurants in Venice, just not at The Piazza San Marco.

What other superlatives can be used when reviewing this place. Was not prepared for the scale of it! We visited on a clear sunny cold windy day. It was tremendously busy but we had so much fun. Got the funicular railway up and then you had to walk. This is not something to contemplate if you have mobility issues - however it is wonderful - steep climbs lots of steps and spectacular views.

"We visited this section of the Great Wall as part of an organized group arranged through the hotel, and we did so because its supposed to be the less popular section (i.e. less crowded) which isn't necessarily the case.  It should also be mentioned that photos can be deceiving as the walk up to the cable car is very steep and when you actually get to the top of the hill where the cable car lets you out, there's more stairs to the entrance of the wall near tower #14.  The area is very crowded and the entrance to the wall itself is very steep with large stone steps so if you're not able bodied you're going to have a very difficult time.  Once on the wall itself, your physical fitness will definitely be tested as there are inclines of 70 degrees in places over uneven surfaces and in some areas large crowds seem to gather which make passing on narrow sections difficult.  Overall its an amazing location and experience but be prepared to work for the enjoyment!!",1,train

We were there in November and it was packed with tourists, as were the narrow streets leading to the Rialto.

The surrounds are gorgeous, mountains covered in snow behind lovely old buildings, chapel bridge, swans and ducks everywhere, boat rides/cruises around the lake. We did a cruise - for an hour I believe and it was wonderful. We went in the afternoon so we’re sure to dress warm as it gets cold in December on the lake in the afternoon. The ride on lake was amazing with great views to take in and absolutely worth doing while in Lucerne no matter the season or time. The one hour cruise suited us in the afternoon allowing us to fill our days with other activities and not too long if you have kids/teens. Walking around the lake is a must as well. We walked all the way to the chocolate factory which was probably 20 min walk or so.",0,train

We did a boat ride from Fluelen to Brunnen in late October and we were totally impressed by the charm of this part of lake Lucerne.

"We saw the Colosseum with no crowds.  The Covid-19 thinned the crowds to almost nothing.  We were still staged - they only want so many in at a time but maybe 5 minutes/10 but nothing long.  We had booked our Italian tour through Ciao Tours of Vancouver.  They furnished a guide Valentina Crivellari who has a PhD in Humanities from Padua (art, archeology, history, architecture etc)  she used an IPad with Colosseum and Forum loaded on it so when she faced a certain direction the Colosseum looked like it did at its height.  That was one thing which was fantastic but her knowledge of the Colosseum was phenomenal.  She had been a guide for 25 years and knew what was the best as well as stories of what happened.  She was well liked by the Colesseum personnel who teased her and greeted her as we past them.   If anything I would highly recommend getting a LICENSED ROMAN GUIDE who has to past tests to be licensed.  Since there was no crowd we enjoyed the time.",1,train

It was a rainy day when we drove the hiur and a hakf to the least busy entrance to one of man's greatest achievements . My advice is to take the cable car or ski lift to the level where you can complete the climb via the stairs. The initial view of the wall is absolutely spectacular. You look down to see it  winding its way up and down through the mountaiside, its protectuve barrier easily evident. Be sure to walk  a ways on the wall and imagine what it must of been like to fend off the invading forces as they tried unsuccessfully to climb up and over the towering brick fortress.

It is a remarkable piece of engineering, architecture and history. Visit the several museums on the connected islands. There are also fortifications, barracks, residences (people live there full time), church, workshops, shops, cafes and restaurants. You will need at least half a day to visit and will take a 15 minute scenic ferry ride starting at Market Square but the ferry convenienty runs all day starting very early and ending late in the evening because people live there.

It is completely chaotic without any sort of order.  Once inside I realised that half of the mosque is covered by a huge scaffolding and completely ruins the experience.

We were drenched by the time we entered the magnificent edifice and quickly discovered that the “underground” visit was shut because it was flooded. However, determined to get our money’s worth in the dry we spent much longer in the museum section and benefitted hugely thereby. Whilst we could not get into the underground, the museum had excellent models showing how the animals and gladiators arrived at the Colosseum and were delivered into the arena; we learnt a lot. The museum also includes the time-line history of the building, itself quite a surprising story. Of course, much of the building is open to the elements so we also walked the levels and marvelled at the sheer scale of it all.",1,train

"We came prepared, packed up a couple of croissant sandwiches with meatloaf that we quickly put together from our breakfast buffet, wrapped nicely in napkins and placed in ziploc. Prepare to layer up and down. This saved us during the hike and packed couple of bottled water. Hired a private chauffeur that drove us from our Beijing hotel to the Mutyanyu entrance. Picked us up at 7am and it was a 2 hour drive. We had the car all day. Hiked at our own pace. Driver waited at the parking structure. We bought four tickets per person at the ticket office. There are a ton of stores before the shuttle pick up. I strongly suggest to buy walking sticks. But try to bargain down to 5 USD equivalent per stick.  Tickets to buy: A. Shuttle that will take you to entrance of the wall B. Entrance tickets to the park C. Cable car tix from entrance tower 14 D. Return chair lift which can also be used as tobbagen tix from tower 6.  As we reached tower 14 by cable, we made a left to go all the way to 23. It was not an easy hike but sticks helped a lot.this was a 2-3 mile incline more or less then going down to tower 6 is another 3. We stopped to eat our croissants at tower 16.  Breathtaking views. Definitely the best part of our Beijing trip. Cant miss this. Go early to beat crowd.  Chauffeur was waiting for us at end of day.  Exhilarating experience!",1,train

"The square is a great backdrop for photos and is very lively and pretty. Lots of posh cafes and shops (which we avoided because we heard they were unnecessarily pricey). The main thing that is off-putting is the number of tourists who find it amusing to feed the pigeons and take photos with them. This causes them to swarm in great numbers and is fairly disgusting to watch given that pigeons are said to be disease infested. Either way, it would be hard to come to Venice and not visit this famous square.",1,train
"Unfortunately it rained when we visited the Great Wall. The cable car ride through the mist and clouds was marvelous. Walking and climbing the slippery steps to the wall was not so much fun. The photo provided for this review shows a blue sky which is a myth anyway given the pollution around Beijing. The locals call a blue sky Olympic Blue, meaning that clear skies are produced by the government for the tourists who attended the Olympics and not for the residents who live in Beijing. The wall of course is impressive and surprisingly wide. However, in winter it must have been a miserable place to have guard duty.",1,train

"Fantastic visit to the Colosseum today. We were planning to take a tour but in the end self guided. This was a good decision - we saw a few tour groups where they were stuck in the sun for long periods and it was just too hot for that! There is plenty of information on the route most of which is “inside” and nice and cool.  We paid extra for access to the arena floor, this was great but not entirely necessary because the regular route seems to just bring you out to an area at ground level on the opposite side of the arena anyway.  Tip: We do wish we had booked a guide for the forum where there is less information and it is much harder to imagine what it would have been like, compared to the colosseum which has pictures, models and artists interpretations showing it at various points throughout its history which really brought it to life.",1,train
"We had two days in Beijing and planned to do a visit to the Great Wall on one day and see the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square on the other day. We checked into our hotel late Thursday afternoon. The excursions office at reception was closed but later that evening it was open so we enquired about the Great Wall. The excursion on offer was quite interesting. It comprised travel by coach to a Ming Tomb, a visit to a Jade Factory, the Great Wall, with cablecar passes, and a tea tasting session. The cost was a shade over £50 each, including the cablecar tickets which wasn't included in the tour. That seemed to offer great value. We were picked up from the hotel at around 8 am next morning and the first stop was at the Ming Tomb. Quite interesting and impressive. Then we went to the Jade Factory. More of a shop than a factory as we only saw a couple of people actually making anything. We did get a very nice lunch there so I suppose it was worth it. Then on to the Wall. Unfortunately our guide wasn't that great. She spoke English but was almost unintelligible most of the time so we missed out on a lot of the information. She also walked very quickly and had no patience for anyone who doesn't, like me. She would race off into the distance and leave me way behind. We eventually got to the entrance to the cable car and all joined the queue. Clearly our tickets didn't get us to the head of the queue as had been suggested. Having queued for about half an hour alarms sounded and a chap started bellowing something in Chinese through a loudhailer. We learned that due to high winds the cablecar had to be closed. That was unfortunate but I suppose can't be helped. Safety first and all that. So the guide told us we would walk to another entrance to the Wall. It was a long slog which I have to admit I struggled with but got there in the end. I didn't actually make it onto the Wall itself but got close enough. There was a huge queue waiting to climb a very steep set of steps about 100 metres up to the wall and then to come back down again. I decided I was close enough. I had got some good photos. We walked back to the coach and went on to the Tearoom, where we sampled some different types of tea. I haven't drunk a cup of tea for over 40 years and wasn't too keen to try these. I wasn't wrong! Most of them tasted pretty foul. All in all it wasn't a perfect outing in many respects but it was a once on a lifetime opportunity to see one more of the man made wonders of the world and I'm very glad I did it.",1,train
"If you want to go individually, not with organized tour, we were offered the option to go by taxi. The taxi left us to the bus station were we bought tickets for the bus, the entrance and the cable.

Take your time taking it all in & make sure to wear good shoes - lots of uneven/cobble stone steps up & down. But THE BEST part is taking the tobaggon/slide on the way down!!!!!!!!! Unforgettable!!!!

"So much hype about the Hagia Sofia but such a mediocre place. Yes entrance is free with long queues and eager people running to the entrance as if this place will disappear in a moments notice. Once you are inside you are expecting something magnificent but soon you will disappointed by the sheer chaos, people taking of their shoes and then you find the confusion of Turkey itself. A church as soon as you enter and then a converted church into a mosque. Turkey is very much a confused country, trying to be Asian and European at the same time. Visit this place because it's free but don't expect anything that will take your breathe away. First time travellers will probably rave about Istanbul as is the case with anyone travelling to another country for the first time.",0,train

The city is so clean - that if you see a wrapper on the ground - you feel compelled to pick up and put in the trash.

We were their during the start of Carnival - which starts at 5am with an actual canon going off on a boat. Constant bands, marching bands, parades, people getting dressed up in costumes - a really cool experience - except - it transforms the city from the cleanest to the direst in 1 hour - litterally at 5:15am the place was mess. The first day they partied until 3am (the Hotel gave us ear lougs - nice touch) - and I will tell you by 10 am the next morning - the streets were clean.

Sibelius Monument . Uspenski Cathedral . Old Market Hall, has served its customers since 1889. . Senate Square - Plaza in Helsinki . We stopped at Robert’s coffee for a 45 minutes lunch. We headed to the Ferry to Suomenlinna straight after lunch. The travel time is approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  Suomenlinna Sea Fortress is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (1991), it was built in 1748 by Field Marshal Count Augustin Ehrensvärd, spreading over a series of six small islands. The site is a nature area with centuries-old artillery and defensive walls. I was impressed by the outstanding fortification founded at that time. You will walking around nature, in one island only.  I highly recommend this tour if you are new to Helsinki. The tour duration was enough as we were in a VAN for the first few hours, and as we reached the fortress, the tour changed into a walking tour.  SEE photos of Suomenlinna.  SEE my review of Helsinki Tour",1,train
"Lovely network of old narrow streets with lots of shops, cafes and bars. Nice traditional buildings, and just great for wandering around and stopping for a coffee. There’s the night market on Friday Saturday and Sunday evenings when many streets are traffic free and the area is even more vibrant. It’s als a good area for tasty cheap food.",1,train

"One of the most famous historical sights in the world, this is a highlight of any trip to Rome.  Entry is timed to avoid too many visitors at any one time, we bought tickets in advance online.  On arrival we then had to queue up for about twenty minutes to get the actual tickets (including tickets for the children who enter for free, but still require a ticket).  I think you can also buy tickets on arrival but the queue is much longer, and time slot would not be guaranteed.  There are various different guided tours if you pay extra, but we found it was enough to look around by ourselves.  The same ticket then gives access to the Forum, for which there was another long queue even though we already had the tickets.  Bring water and expect to be standing around waiting, well worth the wait though.",0,train

"We bought VIP tickets for the 148th floor, whilst definitely more expensive,  the views and complimentary snacks and Arabian tea is worth it. We visited during october and the viewing decks were almost empty. Great for taking lots of photos without having to wait or be conscious of other guests. Discounts in the gift shop were also unexpectedly welcome.",0,train
The foundation shows every night were fantastic. Just nearby The Dubai mall. Too crowded but well organised. The view is amazing anytime.,0,train

"We had a pleasant day trip to Suomenlinna. This was our school assignment, and we chose to visit the Sea Fortress as a visit&observe task. On the day we visited the attraction, the weather was pretty harsh because it was raining and snowing, which made the air very cold. Because it is winter and we are Finns, we are used to this kind of weather, as it really didn’t bother our experience. We have visited the place also during summer, and it is a wonderful, breathtaking attraction, which we highly recommend to everybody.   Because the COVID-19 is still shaking the world and the situations in every country, it was expected that the Sea Fortress would have places fully closed as well. Even despite the COVID-19 situation, we really had a wonderful visit, and we enjoyed the attraction! :)))  We recommend every single Finn or a foreign visitor to go and experience Suomenlinna themselves and support the local businesses, as well as the attractions!",1,train
When you reach this place you see why is the heart of Venice. Is a place that brings smile on everybody's face. There are places with live music which are letting each other play as the customers should listen the best. This square is linking the western more modern part of Venice with the eastern side more classic and old Venice. As the sun sets Piazza San Marco is becoming more glamouros. And the tower and the basilica are supervising everything. Enjoy!,1,train
Worth the visit.. doesn't take a long time because it is not a museum anymore. I think you are not allowed to go inside without a guide,0,train

"Stunning views, beautiful art work and a great photo opportunity. Only detractor is that the staff have no concept of social distancing - 2+ families crammed into a tiny lift, and when I requested we wait for another, it was not well received by the girl staffing the elevator queue. Not 2 meters at all.",1,train
Well worth the walk around and climb of the tower but super crowded and you get moved on if you sit for too long. The best way to enjoy it is to buy a coffee and sit as it becomes really crowded and you have to dodge pigeons.,0,train

Thanks to all the guys and gals that rent the umbrellas and chairs who keep the place clean,  The water is shallow and warm most of the yeaar.  You can rent a chair and umbrella or bring your own.

The Ill River runs through Strasbourg and splits into several channels; there are locks in some places. During the Middle Ages, this area with plenty of water became the place for tanners, millers and fishermen to live and work. In 1988, UNESCO designated the area a World Heritage Site. The name Petit France was given to the area because there was a hospice here for people with syphilis and syphilis was known as ""the French disease"". The area is lovely with historic buildings, restaurants, flowers, trees and shrubs along the river. Our group stopped to listen to church bells under a willow tree - peaceful.",1,train

love going from one famous bar after another- standing in the square and listening to them taking their turns playing music- Great old coin shop in far corner- do not sit down at fancy places - they charge big time surcharge per person just to sit down ..

On our first visit to Switzerland we were confused with whether to do Lucerne or Interlaken and whole Jungfrau experience but good we decided to do both. We settled on doing Mt Rigi and did not do Mt Pilatus as time was less but it was worth every penny. Lucerne is a beautiful town will scenic views and cruise on lake lucerne was the highlight of our trip . Wounded Lion and Old chapel bridge were beautiful . Small shops selling cuckoo clocks were town’s biggest attractions. To my surprise Lucerne had best cuckoo clock prices , infact better than Zurich .",1,train

You will have to leave your shoes at the entrance and, if you have a stroller, like us, there is a special place. Acces is restricted during prayer.

Layered clothing defiantly the answer. We took two public busses to get there because we missed the shuttle bus which leaves daily AT 8am not FROM 8am as the information we’d seen had suggested. If you’d going to take a public bus, have the destination written down in Chinese! We walked half an hour up to the wall, about two hours along it and then about 20 minutes back down. There’s a cable car and toboggan option down but I’m not sure it’s worth it, we got down faster walking! If you can keep walking along the top after the crowds have petered out, it’s steep but I promise it is totally worth it! Take a snack and if it’s winter, a flask of something warm! Enjoy it!

Not only did it start with 101( not sure where the other 100 parts went) but each point lasted 30s before you had to decipher on the map where to go next. There was no structure or theme to the entire audio, which you had to type for the part of the guide. Info on the guide included 'this is a marble door', no real information learnt. Was tempted to go outside and hire my own guide having paid 100Lira for the privilege.

First when I came from the ferry I wasn't very impressed, it looked like an average pretty archipelago village. But it's a whole different story once you get to the other side and I loved it there. End of March, winter weather and I was pretty much alone when I got to the King's Gate. This made the experience even better, despite the harsh weather conditions.

MOST IMPORTANT: 1) Don't miss taking an online ticket otherwise, you would be charged a very high price ticket.  2) It would be good to be mentally prepared for long queues for going up and likewise while coming down. It is cumbersome like all ""waits"", however, do not miss going up.  3)Do not forget to enjoy Dubai Mall Aquarium and Dubai Fountains that are adjacent. Summary you can spend a whole day here.

"If you have an opportunity to see the Great Wall, particularly on a layover using the 24-144 transit visa, there is no reason not to see it! To see this Wonder of the World and to understand the sheer architectural feat that it is remains truly incredible and impressive.  The Mutianyu portion of the wall is DEFINITELY less crowded. Per my guide, going in the afternoons (as we did) is optimal, as it is more crowded early in the am. We quite possibly saw no more than about 30-35 different people on the expanse of wall that we traversed - between Towers 6 & 8. We took the Chair Lift up and the toboggan down (so much fun!) - which I would encourage. You can also take a separate lift up to the higher towers, but would not be able to do the toboggan which is only located near gate 6.  Warning for people with knee issues - while some of the steps are not super steep, they are uneven - with some shallow and some steeper steps, which may make things more complicated with some of the inclines.",1,train

Long queues but they were ticking fast The walk up to the highest point of the wall – Tower 20 I think – is steep but magnificent. It took me about 40 minutes. Hung out there for a bit and descended downTo be at the coffee shop by 2 PM.

"This is one of the seven wonder that we are looking forward to. However, our experience turned out to be a little disappointed based on our experience. Firstly, the location is not quite accessible via public transport and the public transport it is not foreigners friendly because there is no English sign which one needs to speak/ read Chinese in order to get around. After some research online through some traveller bloggers, we managed to find our ways getting to Mutianyu by public transport. First, take metro to Dongzhimen metro station, then proceed to exit C to public bus station (note that there is no clear sign which you may have to ask around to navigate). At the bus station, take 916快(which means 916Express). Make sure you have the Beijing transport card “易通卡”which works like Octopus Card in London, so that you can tap in and out of the bus. If you pay cash, there will be no change given, so make sure you have small notes. Bus916快 will have indication of the name of next destination, but it’s all in Chinese. You need to alight at bus stop named 怀柔北大街. Then, transfer to a taxi to Mutianyu Great Wall. Try to look for taxi in blue colour which is the local taxi by meter. The taxi ride should cost 40-50yuan. Some taxi driver may ask for 50yuan directly. Do not pay more than 50yuan per ride as that is the maximum standard charge even by meter. The same method to go back, but it can be a hassle to wait for taxi when going back. Take note that some taxi driver will bring you to some touts trying to sell you entrance tickets to Mutianyu Great Wall which we encountered. Just turned down politely and proceed to ticket counter to purchase the entrance tickets. Entrance fee plus shuttle bus to the Mutianyu entrance is 60yuan, cable car ride is 100yuan one way. We took cable car up which reach tower 14, then walked up to tower 23 and return to tower 6 and took toboggan down at 100yuan. It is cheaper to take return ride for cable car or chairlift up and toboggan ride down which cost 120yuan for return trip respectively. Otherwise, the single ride will be 100yuan per ride since both cable car service and chairlift/ toboggan service are run by two different companies. Because we wanted to go up to tower 23 from tower 14 (where the cable car station is located), then walked down to tower 6 to take toboggan down which will cover most of the beautiful sides of Mutianyu. And, toboggan ride was really fun, so make sure you try the ride to end your trip at Mutianyu. It took us 4 hours to complete the trek. Second disappointment was that the whole place is very commercialised with pricey food and drinks. We had brunch at one of the Chinese restaurants named Traditional Beijing Noodle 老北京 (shown in the photo), which the food was terribly salty. Both the stew tofu and wanton soup that we ordered tasted like salted food which we hardly can finish them despite our hunger. The service attitude of the restaurant was very bad too. Before going down by toboggan, we had drinks at one of the drinks stall. Guess what?! A bottle of coke that usually cost 5yuan in Beijing city was charged at 45yuan at the drink stall. It was a blatant daylight robbery!!! Also, there are not many toilets along the trek, even at the drink stall at tower 6, so it’s very challenging for anyone with weak bladder. We visited in early September on a scorching day at 36 degree celcius. Cooler weather may make the trek more pleasant, but will be more crowded too. We Glad that we did it at least once in a life time to witness the extensive architecture of this Seven Wonder, built since 7th BC. Few tips for traveller who wants to explore the Great Wall at Mutianyu: 1) Start early, possibly take the first bus to avoid crowds which you can take many beautiful photos without human/ crowd obstructions. 2) Go during cooler weather, which also means it will be much more crowded. 3) Bring enough drinking water and pack your breakfast/ lunch box to avoid paying a bomb for expensive yet terrible food (refer to the restaurant we went)! 4) Beware of touts trying to sell marked up price tickets, just purchase it from ticket counter. 5) Some fitness level required even this is the most restored part of Great Wall. Do at your own pace, don’t rush. 6) Tobbogan ride is a must to end the trip with a fun ride! 7) If you are looking for more beautiful site (online info) where is less crowded, go to Jin Shan Ling part of Great Wall instead, but it will be further from Beijing about 2 hours car ride.",1,train

The cable car gave scenic views over the valley but WOW when you get to the top and see the wall, your jaw just drops in amazement. From tower 14 you can take the gentle slope to the right or the more challenging one to the left. We did a little of both and you would not believe the angle of the wall, how steep it is even on the ""easier"" sections. You can see the wall on many of the surrounding hills and view towers off in the far distance. We went at the end of October and the autumn colours were just stunning.

"The people are mostly friendly. Peddlars and street vendors don't seem to like their photos taken. The younger generation is very friendly and genuinely helpful. Street vendors are a norm and add character and charm to Hanoi. The food is, in a nutshell, good. The egg coffee is a personal preference. It is an egg custard densely foamed up and served on topof black coffee. I love custard, so I loved it. If you love soupy noodles you will love pho, which is noodle soup with chicken or beef. The spring rolls are actually easy to make and are mostly filled with vegetables. I found them to be overpriced for something so simple. We had something called corn rice with chicken. Loved it. We also saw something that looked like tiny live eels. Turned out to be worms. Eeek... Being animal lovers, we were glad to hear that the local government is discouraging the consumption of dog meat. Didn't notice a single place serving it. I am enthralled by the fact that the city has a history of over a thousand years. You just feel the history walking through its streets.

"Others have commented on the beauty of the wall and surrounding area, and I concur. It is beautiful and unbelievably cool! It’s worth the trip and price of admission!  We went in mid November. Temperature was a couple degrees below freezing when we started hiking around 10 am and a few degrees above freezing when we finished. It was windy, particularly in the valley but less so on the wall. So dress warmly but in layers because the wall can be strenuous. At this time of year, take hat and gloves.  We took the enclosed cable car (rather than chair lift) because the temperature and wind. R/T 240 RMB. A very pleasant way up to the wall. While you could walk up, save your exercise for later.  This section of the wall has towers numbered 1 through 20. The cable car comes in at 14. Around tower 14 is probably one of the flattest section of the wall as you head toward tower 15. But it is not flat. It rolls, sometimes on an incline, sometimes on steps. We hiked from tower 14 up to tower 20 and then down to Tower 6 and back up to tower 14. My Apple Watch reported that was about 1600 vertical feet over ~3.5 miles round trip. The final pitch of stairs up to Tower 20 is very steep. So this hike is not for the faint of heart - it is challenging even for those who are fit.  You don’t need to hike the length to enjoy the beauty. And I wouldn’t necessarily say any portion was better than another. So definitely go even if you aren’t prepared for major exertion.",1,train

"A reasonably priced ferry by Market Square will get you to the fortress.  The ride is free if you have a Helsinki Card.  There are ferries every twenty minutes.  There is a vending machine that is fairly easy to use to purchase tickets.  The ride over to the fortress on a large ferry is less than 15 minutes.The Fortress area is home to about 900 people and a Naval Academy.  There is even a store on premise and a half dozen cafés.  There are actually several islands connected by bridges. The Fortress is actually “free” to explore.  To tour and explore the island, though, will take several hours. Close by the ferry is an informative visitors center.  Follow the “BLUE TRAIL” and you will not go wrong. We wandered off and eventually found the residence section. One of the first features you come by is the Church. Not as interesting as the large Cathedrals in Helsinki.  The canons used as a “gate” does make an interesting picture though. Unfortunately, the Fortress is not conducive for ""handicap"" people.  We saw one couple struggling with a wheel-chair.  Hopefully, someday a smoother route could be made for all people.  The “BLUE TRAIL” will take you all the way to the end by the famous area known as “Lions Gate.” There are a number of interesting canons and great views of the Gulf of Finland. Today Suomenlinna is a huge public park where people stroll and have picnics on sunny days. It wasn’t always that way as the islands were used as a fortress. The Swedish under the commander Augustine Ehrensvard started building the fortress back in 1748. He was so well loved that his grave is actually along the trail. A Spartan’s helmet signifies where Augustin is buried.  It really does make for cool pictures.Eventually there was 5 miles of fortress walls and over 500 canons.  It was so well protected; the fortress acquired the nickname of “Gibraltar of the North.” The Russians eventually took it over.  In 1855 the fortress received severe damage when British and French fleet bombarded the fortress during the Crimean war.  In 1917 Finland became independent and called the fortress “Suomenlinna.”  We did enjoy going to Piper’s Café.  It is situated on top of a hill overlooking the Gulf of Finland. On some days they have Salmon Soup and always tasty desserts.  The Menege Military Museum was by far very interesting as it depicts military artifacts associated with Finland from the 19th century.  There is a German tank, a Rolls Royce Car known as the “Silver Ghost,” and a Maxim machine gun that could dish out 600 bullets in a minute.  A Helsinki Card will get you in free.  Close by is the submarine Vesikko which was built in 1933 and is the only Finnish sub that survived WWII.Before you cross over a longer bridge, there is another interesting museum which tells the story of Suomenlinna.  There is a well-liked 25-minute video that will tell you about the history of the area. There is a café here and a much-needed bathroom at this location.  If you are really in the mood to explore there are a number of tunnels.  I would definitely use the light in your cell phone to see the ground.There are no restrictions on jumping on the many canons.  It seems to attract kids and adults alike. In 1999, Suomenlinna was designated as a World Heritage Site. If you found this review “helpful” in any way, please press “LIKE” to let me know.",1,train

This was launched in 1933 as codename CV 707 and was a prototype for German Tyoe II submarines . It is set up as a museum ship and thus restored , it provides a fascinating insight into life and workings of these vessels . The Vesikko and the whole Sea Fortress is easy to explore and totally enjoyable.",1,train

Every visit we have been surprised by various events happening along the waterfront, great place to sit and watch the world walk by.  If you are looking for quiet South Beach is not for you, we are in our 50’s and love to see action, watch young people be young and feel the pulse and energy of a hot spot.  The noise of music and traffic come with that and we love it on Ocean Ave.  Stayed at the lovely restored Victory hotel with a balcony to take advantage of the action.  If you are not like us and want quiet, you might want to consider Collins Ave., but you will need to walk further to beach and action.

"The Colosseum is amazing of course but you have to be prepared to endure crowds, figure out the tickets, dodge touts and in summer endure the heat as well. We had a brilliant day but there are a few things that can make or break your day…  TICKETS - We bought tickets on the day at the ticket booth near the Forum. We got lucky and didn't have to wait long (maybe half an hour). I wouldn’t recommend doing this because you could easily get stuck in very long queues. We only did it because we have been before and were happy to take our chances on the day. Buying online in advance is much safer and the official site is the cheapest place. The ticket system had changed since we had last visited. There were 4 different ticket combos. The basic ticket includes the Colosseum, the Forum & Palatine (€12). All tickets were valid for 2 days BUT they only allowed a single entry into each site. I have included a photo of ticket options below (although I believe they have changed yet again).  TOURS - We didn't do a tour this time but only because we have done tours twice before. Without a doubt, the best thing we did was the Underground tour which took us below the Colosseum first and then right up to the very top level. It was brilliant. It is worth noting that you can’t access these levels on the basic ticket – only with a guide. I’d highly recommend doing one of the tours (there is a variety available). A tour fills in all the fascinating historical and technical details about how the seating and stage worked, how it was built, etc. Underground, we saw where the dungeons where the gladiators and wild animals (lions, panthers, bears and rhinos) where held until they were lifted by elevator to appear on stage on the arena floor. We could also see the channels that carried water inside the Colosseum and allowed them to flood the arena for lavish displays of naval battles. It must have been incredible theatre. From the top, you look back down over the Colosseum and it is laid out in front of you. It’s a breathtaking perspective.  TIPS • Don’t miss the small display of artefacts, diagrams and models, inside on the second tier. This was very interesting and had a lot of panels with very good, detailed information here. • Be aware that the basic entry ticket only allows you to go to the first and second tier, not the top level, the arena or underground. • Take some time to walk around the outside and look at it from different angles. Once you move further away from the front entry lines, you can often get a photo without people in front of you. • Persistent touts will try to sell you all sorts of things, from tours to tacky souvenirs. They can wear you down but the best strategy seemed to be to avoid eye contact if possible and don’t stop, just keep walking. • You can be on your feet for a long time and I was glad I’d worn flat, comfy shoes. In summer, take water and sunscreen too.",1,train

So if going to this attraction I advise you research what you pay for. I think our ""tour"" was only a gaurenteed entry ticket. The attraction is fascinating and well worth the effort. a Half day if you want to absorb everything there.

All my life I always wanted to visit the colosseum but to tell you the truth I didn’t enjoy it much. I think it might of been the guide that we got that we didn’t understand anything and plus we were constantly in a rush and hurry.

It's wonderful since there's options to get up via cable car. However it's not very accessible for any disabled person. Walking up to the cable car station is still possible using the elevator but coming down from the cable car station is a bit unfriendly for my disabled husband as he was not able to use the elevator to get down from the station to ground area. The elevator is only accessible from the entrance section. We tried to talk to the officer mending the cable car so he could allow us to use the elevator but was quickly chased out before we could request.,0,train

I have been to 2 other sections of the Great Wall and this bar far is the best experience. If you want to ride the toboggan down from the top then you should take the gondola up to section 6 and the toboggan down if your adventurous. If you are not going to do that then I would take the gondola up to section 14 and take the gondola back down. Section 14 is much higher and the views are incredible. If you have small children DO NOT take the toboggan down. I feel it would be very dangerous.,1,train

There is a long walking path next to the beach that makes moving from one part to another easy. The beach is often very crowded and there is a lot of activity, volleyball etc. Along the beach are areas where you can hire a deck chair and an umbrella. I loved watching the afternoon fleet of cruise ships leave the harbour from the south end of the beach - starts about 5pm.",1,train
This plaza is huge! I came a week after the floods and all I can remember was watching the guy swimming in waist high water. It’s a beautiful and it overlooks a great basilica. What I can do without are all of the pigeons! Thousands it seemed like! People are feeding them and they are flying in and out. Not to mention the poop going everywhere. And let’s say you want to sit down and have a bite to eat or a glass a wine overlooking the plaza. Be prepared to pay just to sit down before you even order from the menu. It’s a great place to walk through. But it’s not one of the main stops in this beautiful city.,0,train

We loved the little local galleries and taking a cyclo through the streets.  It's slightly organized chaos and it is an act of faith to walk out into the sea of oncoming traffic.

The underground level actually isn’t too special, not much extra to see that you couldn’t see with the normal pass.

1.The beach was packed with people on the Christmas day and looked very full. It felt like there was no space and lots going on. None the less beautiful beach! 2.The water was blue/green and clear at the shore. 3.I would not suggest this beach if you are seeking privacy or to relax(unless you come early morning). 4.Life Guards on duty and were very attentive for the safety of several swimmers that get into the water. 5.Parking is not easy and public parking is not cheap even if you find parking garages that are located far away from the beach.  Have fun!,0,train
"Been here ever since I was a child, and I'm always impressed every time I come here.  It's a nice atmosphere of an old but modern place. It's a great place if you're wanting to know more about Hanoi's history and traditions. there are many traditional foods, clothing, and old buildings. But if you're more into fun festivals, parties, concerts,... we have it all! The place is also very calm and peaceful.

The lights at night are also awesome in Piazza San Marco.",1,train

"I am not a history buff, but I do find history interesting. Hagia Sophia is a place of historical importance, a breathtaking massive beautiful building. I felt totally at awe at by the sheer size of it, considering when it was built, and the history of it. You walked into an entirely different ambiance of that of the modern world. It is like you step into different time, different 'world'. If you go to Turkey and in Istanbul, I think you must see it. To put your feet on the ground of something so magnificent... it will stay with me for a very long time.  Hagia Sophia was a church and center of government in the Byzantium time and Eastern Roman empire. It was taken over by Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman and turned into a mosque. The Christians attributes were all covered during the period, now they are uncovered and you can see the mozaic and traces of chisselled out crosses. They 'live' alongside Arabic calligraphy. Just beautiful.",1,train

Get up around 8am, have a relaxing breakfast and then visit the wall before the throngs of tour groups (international tourists, school groups, etc) arrive.

It was really easy to book through app and our tour guide Mitch was fantastic. Really knowledgeable and friendly.  He brought us to the Colosseum at the end of the tour in order to miss the early queues. When we visited the Covid-19 restrictions were in place which meant temperature checks before entry and drastically reduced crowds than normal.  The Colosseum is magnificent and has to be seen in person to be truly appreciated. We didn’t take the option of the below arena level tour and didn’t feel like we missed out. We weren’t rushed and had plenty of time to take everything in.  I’d definitely recommend a guided tour as it added so much to the overall experience",1,train

We did the Lake Lucerne boat ride while going to Pilatus and it was very nice. The views were very good all through. Also the walk along the Lake and the chapel bridge is very pleasant.

"I have been dreaming about seeing and walking the Great Wall of China, and the Mutianyu Great Wall did not disappoint. We booked through Addiction Travel (highly recommended!) and were picked up at our hotel at 7:30am. The drive took close to 1 ½ hours from Beijing. There are three options to get up to the wall: walk, chair lift, or gondola. We took the gondola up and were treated to amazing views of the valley below. We arrived before the mad rush, headed left from Watchtower 14 all the way to Watchtower 19, stopping before the super steep portion, and got a chance to take some amazing photos without walls of people in the background. Our 4-year old enjoyed running and dancing up and down the Great Wall.  Definitely wear sturdy closed toe walking/hiking shoes because some of the steps are steep with lots of uneven surfaces. Bring snacks and water for a little picnic up top (everything also gets very expensive at the wall). We spent two hours at the wall, and could have spent more. If we didn’t have a little one in tow, I would have loved to have hiked from Watchtower 1 to 23! Perhaps on another trip.",0,train
"I had such a great time. It was quite a hassle getting there. Took about 2.5 hours to arrive via bus routes from Chaoyang district, but other transportation options are available with better timing. I advise doing research on how to get there once you decide you are going. (There is a bus for about 30¥ that leaves at 8:00 am from Dongzhimen Wai Bus Stop (东直门外公交车站) daily. I paid less than that for a round trip via other public buses but be mindful it will take much longer to reach your destination because of the stops.) I arrived there around noon and there were no lines. I purchased an eticket and I used the QR code on my phone to enter the Great Wall and to ride the shuttle buses (round trip) and cable car (round trip). The views were amazing and surprisingly, it wasn’t busy. I didn’t wait in any lines and I was there for a few hours. They also have a few restaurants, a hotel and souvenir shops that you can check out. It was such an amazing experience. Another item crossed off of my bucket list.",1,train

I heard during summer time you will be walking toe to toe, inch by inch with all the tourist. Take the difficult route for the view, easy route is more relaxed. We did both routes. There are many stalls selling souvenirs before the entrance. Make sure to buy yourself a nice traditional head gear. I got a Mao hat and my wife got a furry one. Make sure you bargain. My hat originally sells for 100rmb I got for 12rmb. My wife's original 220rmb I got for 50rmb. We received so much compliments with the hats. We took it home as souvenir. Enjoy!",1,train

In the evening though when the crowds thinned, the staff policing the square have finished and the sun goes down, the place comes into it's own. You can sit at the back of the square, enjoy a drink and take in the music coming from the bars, enjoying it all at your own pace.",0,train

"As the museum is now becoming a mosque, one cannot see the christian paintings any longer, just the ground floor area, but it is beautiful and worth visiting, not more than an hour even if taking a slow meander.  COVID meant not so many people, but still fairly busy.    Shoes to be removed and headscarves and respectable clothing.   This area is lovely at night with coloured fountains and all the roof tops lit up. . .  worth wandering around even if you don´t want to enter,  and the tram stops just outside the main square.",0,train

"We went to the Wall a few days ago. Breathtakingly BEAUTIFUL views. The cable car up and down was another highlight, scary though exhilarating. We were blessed with fantastic weather, freezing but clear and sunny. This section of the Wall is not crowded at all, just a totally acceptable amount of fellow tourists so didn't feel cramped at any point. The surrounding scenery is remarkable. It's very peaceful, with the exception of the helicopter tour every 20 minutes. Which you can do for 750yuan I think it was. The Wall is a once in a lifetime experience. Perfect opportunity to take those bucket list photos.  Beware of the merchant ladies just after the entrance, they will entice you with fake silk, t-shirts, paintings, and the likes. If you're hard up for souvenirs and belated Christmas gifts for your mother like I was, it's easy to get acceptable prices. They will start with the astronomical figure just to warn you. fake silk garments for 280yuan oh my golly! So if you enjoy a good HAGGLE, it's easily done with this lot.  PS. Gatorades are NOT 25yuan! can be haggled to an acceptable and fair 10yuan per bottle, after a tiring Wall hike.",1,train

"We did two boat trips on Lake Lucerne, both with the newest ship, Diamant. The first trip was from Hertenstein to Luzern 30 mins to go and 30 mins return, and we paid a stunning CHF 95 for two adults and two children. It was on a Sunday with beautiful weather and there was no place to sit on the boat. We found it disappointing and too expensive for such a short boat ride. The next day we did the 4 hour round trip around the whole lake, also starting from Hertenstein, where our hotel was located. We took first class tickets and paid CHF 214 for two adults and two children. Much more reasonable given the duration of the trip and the space available for first class passengers. We thoroughly enjoyed the round trip, despite the weather being less beautiful than the day before. Our advice: take the round trip; it is better value for money; as is a first class ticket.",1,train

Please take note to watch your bags as there does seem to be theives there. We nearly fell victim to one of their tricks, more than likely aiming for my wife's handbag and distracting her attention.  My wife was standing admiring the view when three young people threw breadcrumbs at her feet. Immediately she was surrounded by 9 or 10 Pigeons, almost at the same time 2 Policemen walked casually towards us and the 3 youngters disappeared into the crowd. It took us a few moments to realise what just happened, but very thankful for the Policemen for obviously seeing the situation.

Awesome white sand against unbelievable blue water ... and the lifeguard huts are a nice colorful touch.  The beach is clean and well maintained.   But as other reviewers have mentioned, it is crowded.  While there is plenty of room to lay on the beach and hit the surf, this is not a place to lounge and relax.  And a caution -- there were many people wearing next to nothing, skimpy swimsuits, thongs, and some were even topless.  This can certainly be an unexpected eyeful, especially if you are not accustomed to seeing this on a beach.",0,train

They were very skeptical.  We had to show our negative PCR Covid Test, and health insurance (Seven Corner).Delta is extremely strict with face masks, which we were ok with and made us feel safe. We had a long layover in Paris, so bought (ahead of time) a half day pass at the airport hotel. We took a nap and showered before boarding the next flight to Dubai.3 years ago we were in Dubai and it's was booming. Sadly, we barely saw anyone on this trip. Shops and restaurants are open, but we were usually the only ones there.We had high tea at Burj Khalifa and absolutely loved it!

Lake Luzern is lovely. We walked for about an hour along the north side of the lake from Luzerne on two occasions during our short stay taking a picnic with us.  There is a paid swimming area about 10 minutes around from the town but there are plenty of places you can swim for free. There is also a lido about 30 minutes walk from the town.  We also enjoyed a boat trip on the lake as part of the Mount Pilatus roundtrip but there are plenty of options available around the lake.  I would imagine that if you're into sailing or boating there are plenty of additional ways to enjoy the lake,1,train

Rome is home to me now I fell in love with Roma. The crowd did not bother me since it is a known historic place to visit. I enjoyed every minute inside the Colosseum I purchased the package to listen to the audio with headset, highly recommend the audio for a in depth history of this place or you can get a tour guide but you will be limited on where you can walk around because you are with a group. I solo the adventure and walked for hours inside the Colosseum and dreamed what it was like in ancient times.  I did however dread the heat in the middle of June my goodness it was hot. Bring an umbrella or some light covering not just a hat because that sun will bear down on you in open spaces so you will feel the heat. If your going in the morning till late afternoon have plenty of cold water I recommend 1 liter so you can wash your head to cool down from the heat or put water on a rag and wrap it around your neck or put it over your head I copied someone doing it and it helped out a lot.",1,train

"Loved walking, and dodging all things parked and not parked on the side-walk in this great district. Shopping is great although a lot of the same stuff in different shops. You will find the street names correlate with the goods on sale so one street will sell silver, another leather for eg. If you see something grab it as we didn't carpe diem when passing a few shops and then couldn't find them again. Another thing if you are there on a Friday evening is the street markets came out and they block the traffic off (near the big roundabout close to the water puppet theatre) I realised what things cost at the market (less than what you had previously paid in a shop) so you need to bargain hard. One t-shirt for eg is $VND 40,000 in the markets, double that at least in a shop.  Some people are lovely and you can throw in an Oi Zoi Oi Dat Qua (oh my god that's expensive) and they laugh at you. Others are bit more assertive, one lady told us not to come back into her shop which we obliged. Heaps of great little restaurants, be game, some holes in the wall open upstairs or don't be afraid to sit on the street and eat. Nothing like the smell of moped fumes near your Bun Cha. Just keep exploring and no matter what map you have, understand you will get lost, but just embrace it and allow more time than you think and just go with it. Loved it.",1,train

"Get the ferry from the Market Square in Helsinki, really cheap and easy to do. The ferries run every 40mins or every 20mins at peak times, and run until late.  The sea Fort consists of five islands, you can walk around them all, and the are some museums on the larger Islands. The military museum (in two separate buildings) is interesting and definitely worth a visit, and also free.  There's a grocery shop on island C if you need to buy anything, and a few shops and cafes on the islands, but really it's about walking and exploring outdoors.  There's enough to do here for a full day trip. Take warm clothes if not in summer, the wind can get up and make the islands feel very cold. People do live in the former navy buildings, so be aware that you are visiting someone's home.",1,train

"A nice trip “out of the city” to green islands without traffic. The public ferry is part of the area’s HSL system so you don’t need an extra ticket. The ferry from the Market Square goes frequently but can be very full on sunny days. Suomenlinna (Sveaborg in Swedish) has museums, cafes, a nice children’s play area, and exciting old fortresses.

This was terrific as we didn’t have to turn around and both lift and gondola were at base of mountain near each other.

"One of the most famous and most visited sites in all of Istanbul is the Hagia Sophia Museum which has been recently reconverted back into a Mosque. Of all the touristic sights we had visited while in Istanbul, Hagia Sophia had the longest lines and very limited visiting hours. Since this is now a mosque all visitors must remove their shoes and ladies are required to wear modest clothing. During the standard prayer time the Hagia Sophia Mosque is closed to the public. My entire family had the opportunity to pray inside this place of worship. This mosque is very, very large and extremely beautiful. It was once a Church so you can still see mosaics of angles along the upper ceiling. I strongly suggest that if you are visiting Istanbul for the first time you must visit the Hagia Sophia Mosque…it is really breath-taking and a sight to behold.",0,train

It's breathtaking, lined by its many columns and featuring the beautiful Italo-Byzantine Basilica that shares its namesake.  It tends to be very crowded with lots of tourists but you can get beautiful views with some patience.  There are a lot of cheap souvenir shops in the area that are probably better skipped for more authentic shops away from tourist hotspots but there are several overpriced but lovely cafes that are worth a stop if you'd like to enjoy a cup of cappuccino while people-watching.We enjoyed it even more when we visited (and re-visited) as part of several tours because the guides provided so much information about the history of the surrounding architecture and the area itself.  It's definitely worth a second look at night as well when the simple lighting makes the entire piazza even more enchanting!",1,train
Cleopatra the San Marco is just basically a touristy Gathering Place to get together and go somewhere else. It is surrounded by exorbitantly expensive shops buy Rolex and the like.

"A visit to Mutianyu in the winter is special - especially after a snow storm. I've been to Mutianyu twice (November 2014 and January 2020). Both times were ideal as the crowds were not as crazy as what you hear it can be during the spring/summer months. While the January visit was COLD, it was still beautiful to walk around and take some great photos. The cable car ticket for 120 Yuan was worth the price for the round trip. After a few hours of exploring the Great Wall, you'll want to take the cable car quickly back to the staging area if you're visiting in January. One of these days I'll walk back down or take the slide rail. There are some dining areas that are decent prices, but the souvenir shops were over priced. I enjoyed my tour group as it gave us 4 full hours to explore the Great Wall and down time at the end. The trip was about 60-90 minutes from Beijing depending on traffic.

The Great Wall of China is a must-do for any tourist in the world. We visited the Mutianyu section of the Wall. It was very beautiful and clean. There is a fair bit of climb (gradient and some  steps) from the bus station to the cable car. Sedan Chairs are available @ CNY700/- for a return trip. Quite pricey for a short distance !! From the cable car to the Wall is an easy walk. There are some steep steps before one can get onto the wall. The Wall itself is majestic and  one cannot but marvel at the ingenuity and industry of the makers of the wall. Sun-hat and glasses are useful if the sun is out. On the cable-car ride one can see a jungle of chestnut trees. There is not much to do on the Wall though some do walk the whole section.  Fun and enjoyment is such a personal choice !!,0,train

To get to the fortress you need to take a ferry, which leaves port in the market square at almost every hour of the day and all year around. The fortress itself is a great place to visit even whit family as it has beautiful gardens and many places to have a picnic in the summer. Only negative thing bout the whole trip was the museum as it was to expensive and we did not really find anything interesting. We visited the fortress in late autumn/early winter so the weather was not in our favor, but it still was an pleasant trip and I highly recommend visiting Suomenlinna if you find yourself in Helsinki.",1,train

"On my trip to Rome, I visited tons of fantastic sites. The Spanish Steps, Pantheon, and Trevi Fountain were all incredible, albeit somewhat crowded, sites. The Colosseum was quite different. It did not seem to have as many people inside, which was a good thing. However, the architecture was not very impressive. The history surrounding the site is cool, but the architecture did not really impress me that much. The white, marble colors in the photos are far more brown in real life. The center of the Colosseum  also had a lot of stuff covering the grounds due to construction. Overall, I'm glad I visited and there were some cool exhibits, but this, for me anyway, is the least interesting site in Rome. Granted, it is still worth getting an early ticket for.",1,train

"Mutianyu is the best place to visit the Great Wall - it's less popular' than other portions so you avoid jousting with the large crowds and yet it features some of the most spectacular parts of the Great Wall. A large number of guard towers within a short distance along the wall allows you to experience the environment in different ways. It's a bit of a steep walk up the road from the village at the base to the gondola to ride to the top of the wall, so plan on either taking your time or hire one of the carts rides to cover the distance.",1,train

"Colosseum is a must do!  Great history so definitely should do with a guide.  A lot of walking and was still hot days. So many groups in October and they say summer is a lot worse! Would give 3 stars to our tour thru Gray Line (I love Rome) for bad service, saw Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill in about 2 1/2 hours...a bit quick, left late due to latecomers, otherwise would have been 3 hours.   Then we did Vatican in afternoon (tour was Gray Line $161E each and included lunch--lunch was just ok, would have gone elsewhere...and they made us sit as a group when we wanted our own table).  However, was good that we did lunch so they transported us to the Vatican to meet up with that tour.  Otherwise, you are on your own in between the two tours to find start points.  Can be stressful trying to find start points.",1,train

"I have visited the Colosseum before but it was a first for my husband, so I decided to go all in and buy the full experience guided tour, which included the underground and level 3. However, this was not what we ended up getting. We turned up early expecting the crowds so we could get through security easily & made our way to where the tour was due to start. After waiting for over 30 minutes, the others in the tour were getting restless, so I asked at the ticket information as to when our tour was going to start & I was sent away having been told that someone was on their way. Eventually almost 45 minutes late, the tour guide arrived. Unfortunately as lovely as the lady was, English was far from a fluent language and she had trouble describing elements on the tour, which baring in mind we had booked an English tour, this wasn't the best start. Then after about 40 minutes, the tour abruptly stopped & she was finished but we had only been around 1 floor of the Colosseum, which wasn't the ticket that I had bought -  ours should've been the 75 minute tour! The guide looked at our tickets and told us that we'd been put on the wrong tour & to ask for a refund but told us that it would be unlikely. At this point, my husband was cold and was ready to leave. Luckily, in our favour on the way out, we took a wrong turn and found ourselves on one of the lower floors, so we did end up seeing that bit more yet we did still miss out on a paid for experience! I'm sure that this mix-up doesn't happen often and mustn't take away the beauty & the tragic history of this incredible place. No trip to Rome is complete without visiting this incredible monument. And even with our ticket issue, I'd still buy the ticket in advance as the queues can be horrendously long.",1,train

"Despite the crowds, Venice is still enchanting, but avoiding crowds is the best way to find it. Skipping San Marco - or going at the crack of dawn - is a great way to avoid them.  The piazza is now so crammed with visitors, it is hard to see the architecture or get a sense of the space or what beauty it once radiated. Sitting on any of the steps is prohibited (and patrolled by police) if fighting the crowd wearies you, and buying a cup of coffee in exchange for a seat is probably doesn't get more expensive anywhere in the city.  I was there for a week so it was okay losing an afternoon just to fight our way there, inch our way around the square and shuffle in an endless queue through the basilica, but it was the most underwhelming experience of the week. And that was before the wait to get a vaporetto home.  For anyone with less time, wandering a low-key neighborhood like Dosoduro or San Polo, hanging out in ""the other"" big piazza (Sta Margarita) or spending a day on the water to Burano and Murano covers much more ground and provides much more insight into why this city has enchanted so many for so long.  If Venice wouldn't be complete without at least a glimpse of the Piazza San Marco, walking the relatively short distance to a vaporetto stop off that is not as mobbed as the one on San Marco will save a little time to see something else.",1,train

If you go up to the top deck (with seats), we can take beautiful pictures but do dress up warmly, especially during winter. Otherwise, stay in the covered main deck where certain windows can be slid open. There is a washroom, and we can also buy beverages on-board.

This is where you purchase your tickets for the motor coach ride to the chair lifts. You have the option of using the chair lifts to and from the wall or take the tobaggan down. I opted for the chair lifts in both directions (which I recommend as the views are so breathtaking).  I am sixty two years of age with two artificial knees and had absolutely no problem managing the stairway to the wall...I would recommend some good walking shoes or trainers for 100 or so steps onto the wall. My recommendation to anyone with some disability or artificial implants is to GO TO THE WALL...and take your time. Sadly, I believe this experience is not wheel chair compliant. There are clean toilet facilities, restaurants, cafes and shops. I bought my Great Wall T-Shirt  and purchased fruit and nuts from local vendors, which was so much fun interacting with the locals. I speak Mandarin Chinese, but most everyone working there  speak some English. Needless, to say I was ingratiated with warm hospitality.  I am an U.S. traveller that first came to  Beijing in 1979...I am so impressed with the ease of touring this UNESCO heritage site and recommend it to everyone. I stayed two hours and felt that my visit was sufficient. I intend to return to the Wall at Mutianyu to experience the seasons, the natural beauty and solemnity of the wall in all it's majesty.",1,train

"Some advice: (*) I suggest a private driver just because it is fast and convenient, they can pick up and drop off where you like and at an exact time, and they can help you buy the tickets. I booked a half day tour with a driver via TripAdvisor. That tour operator review is under ""Private Mutianyu Great Wall Trip with English-Speaking Driver"". (*) Leave at 7 AM so you can beat the crowds and take photos early before the masses arrive. (*) Take the shuttle bus from the parking lot/ticket purchase area to the Great Wall. It is a very long walk otherwise that will drain energy you need for walking on the wall. (*) You have to buy the cable car and/or toboggan tickets at the ticket area near the parking lot. And they are two different companies. (*) Take the enclosed cable car up and down to tower (Tower 14). And head towards Tower 23 ASAP. The best views are this way and the last section up to tower 23 is very steep with good views looking down. (*) I took the enclosed cable car to tower 14. Then walked to the end at tower 23. This is the best part of the wall. Then walked all the way back to tower 6 and took the toboggan/slideway down which was a lot of fun. Total time on the wall like 2.5 hours but I walked pretty fast. I saw a lot, but in hindsight that was too much walking for a ""normal"" person especially since there is a lot of up and down and the stones do not have any cushion so the walking is very “high impact” on the joints. Just doing the closed cable car up and down to tower 14 + walk to tower 23 is probably enough for most people.",1,train

Mutianyu is the place is for those who don't really like to climb up to the great wall as they provide the cable car to go up. The view is very nice and you may walk up to tower 21 from tower 14 (if I am not mistaken). Better to take the tour package because it will take you about 2 hours time from downtown Beijing. It is a must-visit if you are travelling to Beijing.,0,train

If you take ski lift, you toboggan down which was fantastic. 1.5 km of track that you can control the speed of car. The wall is fantastic, the views incredible and the steps tiring but well worth it. The history behind the wall is fascinating. Recommend going early in morning when it opens By 11 AM it does get very busy.",1,train

We stayed in Mutianyu and went upto the wall early on a cool but clear autumnal day with the backdrop of the trees turning colour. It was beautiful. For about the first 90 minutes we felt like we had the place pretty much to ourselves but from about 09:30 onwards the coachloads of daytrippers from Beijing start turning up and the tranquility disappears. Nevertheless, this is a must see site however and whenever you're able to do it.  We walked upto the wall from the entrance which is a steep 20 minute walk but there are other options namely a gondola and a chairlift.

It was interesting to find out its multi-use; the military still uses part of the fortress, but they have citizens who live/rent there also.  The military areas are definitely marked to give notice not to enter.  There is enough to keep one busy all day if they care to, but with so much else to see, I only spent about a half day there locally.  They have their own micro-brewery there; however, I was unable to visit.  My water shuttle to/from Helsinki to the islands were  on the M/S Finlandia; all staff were very friendly and helpful.",1,train

"St Marks square is one of those places that many people dream of visiting , and thanks to low-cost airlines, is for many becoming a dream come true . I visited on September 30th ( 2019) arriving to Venice on train from Verona with my family. Like much of Venice , the number of tourists visiting is staggering , and one has to be patient when photographing the sites as there will always ( seem to ) be someone walking across the view you are about to photograph . St Marks square along with the Bell Tower and numerous restaurants, is a hive of activity - as well as the tourists and souvenir vendors , I saw at least one model posing for a picture , and then there were the people feeding pigeons and posing for snaps . It's been around 40 years since I last visited St Marks square , and apart from/despite the increased number of tourists , the magic remains . (P.S) If you are going to tour the Cathedral , then obviously allow and extra hour or two for your visit )",1,train

"At this time it is essential you book a slot ahead of time as visitor numbers are reduced due to Covid. We booked directly from their website which is cheaper than through an agency. Entry was uncomplicated a temperature check and a scan of your baggage. Note that large bags are not allowed. I had a small backpack. There is a lot of preservation going on so at times it is difficult to get a photo without scaffolding etc in. The exhibits inside were informative and we spent about 2 hours inside. Your ticket includes the palatine hill and the forum, which is where we spent most of the day. For me this was just as impressive. Be aware there are no refreshments inside although there are numerous water fountains where you can fill up water bottles. The water is safe. We took a break at a restaurant between the two sites which also gave our feet a bit of a rest.",1,train

"We did the Great Wall with friends during a long layover in Beijing from U S Unbeknownst to me ( I didn’t do my research so I didn’t fully know what was involved in touring it ) I didn’t know you had to cable car up there ..I am afraid of heights . Very afraid! So now I had a problem either go back sit in the airport for an over 20 hr layover Making everyone else in the group miserable ..hygyyyy Or muster up some courage go up there and see one of the wonders of the world ! Well I opted for the latter . It wasn’t easy getting up there ..that’s another review of its own .. but I got up there climbed a few sections ..the steps aren’t even so it’s not easy but the good part is once you start climbing steps you can climb as high as you like or as low as you want or don’t climb at all.. you can just sit under the garrett and just take in the views of the Wall from a distance .. there’s enough wall for all to see .. I’m told it spans some 26,000 miles .. The experience is grand We had perfect weather end of October I would not recommend it when it’s hot because uou expend a lot of energy ..if u do go stay hydrated .. We decided to toboggan down rather than take the terrorizing ride down with the cable car ..at least for me and my “ height fear “ it WAS terrorizing ! The toboggan was a lot less intimidating even fun at times ..I felt better because w the lever you can stop it thereby keeping ME in control .. Well I got down it was exhilarating .. So Do Ii Recommend the Great Wall ? By all means if you have time and the means .. ( not afraid if heights that is) just make sure you fo your research and hav full understanding as to what it involves .... Enjoy .. take lots of water and snacks !",1,train

"We had pre-booked tickets online which also included the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. with a time of 1 p.m  but it wasn't clear at which place to be at for 1 p.m. To be honest it was a bit tiresome trying to figure it all out.  Sent from the Colosseum to the Forum back to the Colosseum. Terrible signage and directions and to be honest pretty unhelpful staff everywhere (we found this quite a bit in Rome), in fact the ticket touts parading outside were of more help. So eventually we get in to the Colosseum where yet again unhelpful staff helped us miss virtually the whole ground floor. With Covid most places have introduced a one way system with no turning back. When  we purchased our audio guides the lady pointed straight to the stairs, i asked we don't start on the ground to which she replied by pointing to the first floor. So off we trot only to realise by the end we had we had missed the ground floor out. So apart from that the place is awesome, the sheer scale of it, the history. It was everything you hope it would be and it doesn't disappoint. And considering what your ticket get's you in to it's very reasonably priced too.",1,train

"We are a family of 4 (daughters 9 years and 17 years of age). We were in Hanoi for 1 day and 1 night only. And we spend the whole time in Old Quarter area. So, frankly we just know 2 things in Hanoi - the airport and Old Quarter area!  Ok, there are thousands of reviews of Old Quarter. I want to try and make the review different. I will only give information from our experience which can be helpful to other readers. So, here goes (in no particular order):  - Hanoi in December is cold, so please carry adequate warm clothes specially if you are out for walking tours or street food. It rains too. - Watch out for the huge number of motor bikes being ridden in the narrow roads of Old Quarter. You have to be careful while crossing the roads. The trick is not to stop in the middle no matter what happens and to maintain a steady pace while crossing. That way the motor bike riders can predict what you are doing and can make their way around you. - Old Quarter also has the famous Beer Street. This is a street with full of pubs serving different kinds of beer. Frankly we didn't experience it. We saw it because it was right next to Essence Hanoi Hotel and Spa (where we had lunch). - Old Quarter has many souvenir shops with good pricing. We found that the rates are the best here compared to souvenir shops elsewhere in Hanoi, Da Nang or Ho Chi Minh City. So, if you want to buy souvenir to take back with you, please buy here even if it is at the beginning of your trip. We made a mistake thinking we will get better stuff elsewhere. - It is advisable to carry VND (popularly called the Dong) currency here. Though many will tell you that USD is accepted in Vietnam, I would advise that you carry VND specially if you want to buy stuff from small shops. Also, many small cafe's accept only cash. - If you are taking a cruise of Halong Bay from Hanoi, let me tell you that most cruise companies provide pick up from Old Quarter area (in this regard check out my review of Unicharm Cruise). So, advisable to stay in a hotel in Old Quarter. - Old Quarter is at least 45 minutes away from the airport by Grab (e-hailing cab service). So, plan your movement from and to the airport accordingly. Keep a 1 hour margin if you are catching a flight so that you don't get a heart attack while going to the airport! - Grab cabs (e-hailing cab service) are easily available in this area and maximum waiting time will be 4-5 minutes for the car to come. In Vietnam, car number plates don't have alphabets. They only have numbers. So, checking for the cab which comes to pick you up becomes an activity which you have to focus on! - Vietnam has left hand drive, which means cars travel on the right side of the road. The first time I sat on a Grab cab, something funny happened. I went to the left front side of the car and opened the door and to my utter surprise saw the driver sitting. The driver also got a big surprise from me!!! - For Hanoi, I have done reviews of the following - 1. Peridot Grand Hotel under Essence Hanoi Hotel and Spa. 2. Essence Restaurant. 3. Unicharm Cruise. 4. Hanoi Old Quarter Walking Tour (in this review I have given details of places of interest visited in Old Quarter like Long Bien Bridge, Dong Xuan Market, Hang Ma Street, Phung Hung Street Art and Hoan Kiem Lake). 5. Ancient House. 6. Diamond Sky Bar and 7. Old Quarter (this review). You can get more information about Hanoi and Vietnam from here. - There is a alcohol retail shop next to Essence Hanoi Hotel and Spa. If you have your back towards the hotel, then walk to your right and on the left side down the road after few shops you will come across a very well decorated alcohol retail shop (am posting a photograph of the same). - Watch out for many local tea/coffee shops with interesting low level tables and chairs (see my picture on the same). You will see many Vietnamese local people sitting and having a coffee, and/or a smoke. - Watch out for interesting rickshaw rides in Old Quarter. In these rickshaws, the passenger sits in front and the rider is riding from behind. - We noticed lots of 7-11 kinds of convenience store chain named Circle K. - The famous Thong Long Water Puppet show is also located in Old Quarter area right next to the Hoan Kiem Lake. - Many areas in Old Quarter during the weekend gets shut for vehicles. You can only walk there. This is great for tourists who want to walk around Old Quarter area. - Must try the famous egg coffee of Vietnam here as there are so many beautiful cafe's all over the place. - You can expect people here to be honest, clever and down to earth. Almost all people we came across in the service industry are excellent in service standards. The best I have come across. They genuinely care for you. More so they will do things out of their job requirement. That's why you will see many reviews of Vietnam in TA will have names of people giving service. And most people here have a great sense of humor. And they are confident people which is great considering they have always been plundered and colonized by the western people. - People in the service industry understand English and can speak English even if not fluently. But, many people on the roads don't know how to speak in English. But, overall for tourists, language is not a problem in Vietnam if you communicate in English. - Food and drinks are cheap overall. So, in Vietnam you can really indulge. A top end dinner with cocktails for family of 4 will not cost more than USD 75. In VND terms (or Dong) this would be mean 1.7 million. So, in Vietnam you can easily have a VND 1 million meal. Therefore, you can easily be a millionaire here!!! That's great fun. - For our Vietnam trip we visited Hanoi, Da Nang and then Ho Chi Minh City. In terms of activities we really enjoyed the following - Halong Bay Cruise, Da Nang and from there Hoi An and Ba Na Hills. Also My Khe beach in Da Nang is a beautiful beach.  You will also find my reviews for hotels, restaurants and activities in Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City.",1,train
"We did a private tour of the Great Wall. I highly recommend it. The tour gave us a driver, private car and an english speaking tour guide which all added up to a day well spent. I have mobility issues and feel this was the best choice for access. There was a bit of climbing but not much. We took the chair lift up to the wall (fun and scary all at once but don't miss it) and tobogganed down which would have been much more fun without the woman in front of us who was terrified (just make sure there's plenty of time between you and those in front of you). Yes I bought the kitschy stuff (love it). Basically it was a check off my bucket list I never thought I would be able to do.",0,train

"A total ripoff  18E for a short museum display on a small section of the Colosseo. To go into the colosseum proper you need to buy an upgrade ticket prior to arriving. Too late if you turn up with the standard ticket, You cannot upgrade at the gate. It was less than an hour in total to see the pissy display. You can only glimpse into the arena. I was not the only one who looked totally stunned to realise ""that was it! "" I was at Verona Arena last week and for 11E you got access to all areas there.

"This is probably the one must-visit sight in Helsinki. Unfortunately, everyone knows this. A few pointers to help:  1. The website is a bit clunky but there is a lot of information to help you plan your visit in advance. As an example, I visited in September when the hours are a bit shorter; lots of sites on the island (such as the church) didn't open until 11:30 or later. This is helpful information for you to plan your route and timing. 2. There is a map on the website as well. You can also pick one of these up at the visitor's center after you get off the ferry. This is important because the signage isn't as good if you don't simply follow the ""blue route."" 3. In September there are guided tours which leave from the museum on Saturdays at 1:30. I took this tour and it was very good. The tour was about 10 or 11 Euro. If you take this tour, I would skip the museum visit to save money as the museum doesn't have that much more interesting information. There is a lot of signage throughout the island explaining the sites. 4. For most visitors, following the ""Blue Route"" will enable you to see what you probably really want to see. 5. In September the main site opens at 10 am. I tried to be the early bird to beat the cruise tourist hoards so took the ferry to make sure I arrived before 10 am. As noted previously, many sites on the route weren't open until later and the tour didn't start until 1:30. If I were to visit again in September, I probably wouldn't arrive until 11:30 or later - that way, you miss some of the cruise tourist hoards and you have ample time to walk around until the tour and everything is open. 6. The monkey wrench is the weather. It can be rainy and windy, which can make your visit difficult if you aren't prepared. During my visit, the day started out nice but then became horribly rainy and windy. You just have to be prepared for anything so you can enjoy the visit. 7. Wear your most comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot and many areas can be slippery.",1,train
Highly recommend visiting this part of the wall and towards the end of the day. We went from 1:30pm-3:30pm and there were not a lot of other people which was great.  Difficult stairs to climb up and down but if you take your time it’s doable. Beautiful 360 views. Very cool piece of history to take in and be able to enjoy hundreds of years later.  Recommend going up the chair lift and down the slide way.,1,train
"We visited Suomenlinna on a tour, after leaving our tour cruise. If you have an option to visit this little island, I would suggest you do!

I did not see any decent restaurants, just tourist light fare, but I could be wrong. Enjoy!",1,train

Once you reach the wall you can chose which route to take we started at tower 14 and went up to 21, it’s a tough walk especially if sunny but take your time admire the fantastic views & history and it really is enjoyable, there are vendors sprinkled around serving refreshments.  If you enter via the cable car at tower 14 you can then ignore this one on way back and go to the next one so you do the entire section, we didn’t have time but this looked like the best route in terms of exertions, there is even a toboggan back down!

Apparently there are 2 types of cable car ride, one is covered and another one is the open car. We took the open car and enjoyed our ride up.

"We booked our tickets to coincide with sunset but unfortunately due to the shambolic queueing system/lifts it took over 50 minutes to get up to the viewing deck, by which point the sun had set (we saw the last 30 seconds or so!) which was a real disappointment.  As pointed out by another reviewer, there are far too many people being allowed up there at any one time and it does not allow for social distancing at all. This is particularly true in the shop area where people are browsing (the overpriced tat), viewing out the windows as well as standing in a huge queue to come down again.  The views were good but having been up many tall buildings on holiday we felt it wasn't one of the best. There was a complete lack of information of what you were looking at from each vantage point and a lot of it is inside which means a lot of photos through glass (Inc the sunset), which isn't great. Shame a lot of the construction /history is on the way out as almost no one has time to read it as people are behind you making their way out.

"Each year since 2007, my wife and I travel to our family home in Macedonia for a month or more to visit friends, relatives and maintain the home there. We always try to put a week aside to visit different countries like Greece, Turkey etc. In August of 2019 we spent a week in Old Istanbul and visited several famous historical sites, one of which was the Ayasofya Museum/Church/Mosque in Istanbul. We were staying at the Yasmak Sultan Hotel and thanks to them, they arranged for a walking tour guide to take us to several historical sites. We paid UMAR,our guide a 100 Euros for the day and it was well worth the price. We were one on one with UMAR and he was personable, educated and incredibly knowledgeable. The best part was because we had a guide, we did not have to stand in the many long lines for these different sites. They had a separate booth for guides to pay and go directly into the location. |The cost for going into the Ayasofya was 144 Turkish lira for the 2 of us. The Ayasofya Church was built was built from 530AD to 535AD by 10,000 laborers and it is all brick and mortar, no steel in the structure. It was a Greek Orthodox church for 1000 years and when the Turks conquered the area it was turned into a Mosque for 400 years. For the last 80 plus years it has been a Museum honoring both the Church and the Mosque. I am not a very religious person but when you walk into the Ayasofya there is definitely a feeling that you are in a very special place, The structure itself is enormous and a tribute to what mankind was capable of building by hand over1500 years ago.The always ongoing restoration of the Ayasofya is in itself a labour of love and a labour of historical art preservation of both the Christian and Muslim religions under the same roof. Everyone educated or not will appreciate this tour as a memory in your mind forever. I highly recommend this tour and doing it with a one on one tour guide like UMAR.. It is money well spent.

I saw the one in Verona as well and, I was told, the one is Verona still has much of its original structure.  I liked it but the Colosseum is still more impressive.

Amazing place. We bought the €16.50 ticket online via headout which also allowed us entry into the main palatine forum and was great value. We went early and no queues at all. Both attractions are amazing if you love history and walking. Some great photo opportunities. The Colosseum took us a couple of hours to take in all of the amazing views. We did walk slowly. You could do the Colosseum itself in under an hour if you needed to. There are 2 bookshops there but seemingly no cafe. They did have toilets in the colosseum on the first level and by the ladies there were water refill stations so my advice is to take a water bottle and refill.,0,train

"Like much of Florida, this beach falls between the Atlantic and a brief nature buffer designed to protect the over-developed waterfront.  The area between the strand and the nature buffer was relatively narrow compared to many other beaches we've been on; winter storms remove much of the sand, and Miami Beach has struggled with beach replenishment.  Umbrellas and lounges are available, but the cost is excessive.  There is a boardwalk (covered in a separate review), but it does not have view of nor is it within view of the beach.  Access to this beach is via the beachfront hotel you are staying in, or via foot at passthroughs from A1A.  Street parking here is very limited and very expensive, so access to this beach is defacto limited to those who stay in the local hotels.  If your primary interest is surf and sand, there are much better beaches to visit.  I will say it was clean, although there were no trash cans in evidence.",1,train

"It becomes difficult, almost stressful if one is in an exotic location for an extremely brief period as to how to make the best use of the limited time available. I was to land in Beijing around noon and had half a day with me. Great Wall is easy to get on the agenda but the tough part is to manage the logistics. That's where Yvonne of came to my help. She picked me up from the airport in her Mercedes Benz C class and drove me to the base office cable car ticket window. Exploring this part of the Wall can take anything between 2-4 hours, it depends on time availability, strength and stamina and interest. The walk on the wall, soaking in the greenery all around is a surreal experience. Words of caution 1. Walk from where rhe cable car drops you to where you reach the wall (only to further walk up and down on the undulating gradient) takes away some wind so be prepared for some strainous workout for your legs. Comfortable shoes are a must. 2. Even in late September afternoon, the sun was hot, so pick up your day and time wisely 3. The walk is not crowded. In fact there were stretches where I was completely alone withe the wall and the jungle around for sustained periods Yvonne was waiting when I came down,to drive me to my hotel in the city and during the drive explaining to me about Beijing.",1,train

The ride takes 5/10 minutes and leaves approximately every 40 minutes. I went to see the castle and a little bit around the island with my spare time. It was really pretty and felt very quiet, like no one lived there anymore so it was very relaxing. It is a nice walk and will fill a couple of hours if you need something to do. I would recommend a visit so you have seen it but wouldn’t recommend to be there all day, also people with reduced mobility may struggle with the hills and uneven terrain.

The island is easy to get to by public ferry. If you have a Helsinki card you can use it to get the ferry and the walking tour for free. Also allows you access to some/all the Muesuems for free on the island (I didn't do any of the Muesuems so don't know if it gives you access for free to all of them that have entrance fees). The walking tour was well worth it to get a good feel for the history of the island and for Finland. Easily spent half a day here and could have spent longer. If you had lots of time in Helsinki and a bueatiful day like I had easily a day spent outdoors exploring without including Muesuems.

"We took the 2-hr trip from Pier 2 (next to Luzern train station) to Vitznau. It takes an hour to get there, turns straight round and then an hour to get back. Ideal if you don't have lots of time to see the lake (and mountains if the weather is nice) The boat makes a few stops along the way, but it is probably better to get on at the train station if you want a seat next to the window as it was quite busy. 2nd class is downstairs - a waitress comes and takes drinks orders, and there is a restaurant serving food upstairs in 1st class. You can get off at Vitznau and visit Rigi mountain for the spectacular views or just stay onboard for the return trip. Adults cost 28 CHF return and kids 11 CHF. If it's cloudy, you won't see so much scenery obviously (you'll see the lake and the bottom of the mountains rather than the top), but it's still worth it. For 'sailors' worried about getting seasick - it's a lake so it's a pretty smooth journey.",1,test

"This was the big entertainment centre for the masses, Roman style. At full capacity, it would entertain fifty-five thousand locals, who would cheer, scream, and boo at the sight of the Gladiators battling one another, killing the beast, or having the Christians mauled by the wild animals. Emperor Trajan, Nero and Caligula were the most bloodthirsty rulers, and their many appearances at the gladiatorial battles meant that over some time, almost ten thousand gladiators and beasts were slaughtered. I did read that a thousand animals bit the dust on certain days, which is a bit hard to grasp, even though the early writers have never disputed this.  When I visited the pleasure dome, it was pockmarked and ravaged. Still, in its heyday, one could imagine the richly decorated interior, with its large holding pens for the gladiators, beast, and slaves in attendance for the bloodthirsty spectators. I did shut my eyes for a few minutes and let my imagination run free, shutting out the ravages of time to imagine when it was filled. Most likely it was divided horizontally into five different sections of socially ranked divisions, with the Emperor and his entourage in the deluxe stalls looking down on the less wealthy thrill-seekers. All eyes would be glued on the two entrances where the chariots and gladiators on foot were preparing for battle in the arena, while equally riveted on the other access where the bodies of the wounded and vanquished were carted out.  Patricia mentioned that we should determine the logistics and the feasibility of capturing and transporting hundreds of animals from Africa and then across the Mediterranean to Rome. Imagine the size of the elephants, lions, leopards, African bears, and rhinoceroses that were sedated for this long journey, and finally, coax them to ferocity in front of a bloodthirsty Roman crowd. The blood baths may have gone out of fashion, but the Colosseum's magnificent architecture is timeless. It must have been a sight to behold. NB: This was my tour in 1980. I would hand out these tour pamphlets to my client who visited my agency in the 1980s.",1,test

"This is one of the most important structures in Istanbul, and it is unmissable.  A delight for history buffs, and photo buffs. But, please, don't try to do this on your own.  Guidebooks and the internet can give you a lot of information, but you ought to get a good local tour guide who speaks your language, OR, you ought to join a specialised organised tour that covers this site. There is too much to see, and too much to get explained. Our local travel agent in Istanbul, Efendi Travels, organised a guided tour of this place. This huge structure was a church for around 900 years under the Byzantine emperors, built by the Emperor Justinian in the year 537. Then, it was a mosque for about 450 years under Ottoman rule. Finally, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, converted it to a museum in 1935, in keeping with his secular principles. Now, it is a museum dedicated to both Orthodox Christianity and to Islam.  As a church, it was the largest church in Christendom. The dome is still one of the largest in the world, and is very impressive both from outside and from inside. The minarets were added by the Ottomans.  Some other striking features: the four large Ottoman Medallions with huge calligraphy, the mosaics, and the Seraph figures.  Your guide will point out all these to you, and give you explanations.  I am very sorry we were pressed for time, I would have loved to spend about three hours here. Sadly, we got only half that much.  Very easy to negotiate with a stroller.  There are good toilet facilities outside the church. It would help if you had binoculars, some of the details are so high up, (and the place is not too well lit!) it is a bit difficult to see it properly with the naked eye. I used my camera's zoom lens, but a pair of binoculars would have been better.",1,test
Definitely worth while doing this once although it’s just like all land Mark buildings and site seeing great views and busy .,0,test
This was the culmination of a lifelong dream to walk on the Great Wall. Mutianyu is a lesser traveled entry way and it comes with a cable car to make the climb to the top and a thrilling luge ride to descend off the wall if you are so inclined. There is a small tourist oriented village at the base filled with trinkets and food. The wall was been reconstructed to its former glory and you can walk for miles but it rapidly becomes strenuous as the wall follows the contour of the mountain top. Do not miss the chance to see the Wall!,1,test

While we were walking around the outside, many locals tried to get us their services, but you don’t need any of that if you just want to explore on your own.

"We visited the Great Wall of China, Mutianyu section in December 12, 2019. We are a family of nine (9), eight adults and one kid. It was -7 C when we left Beijing downtown area at 7am. The weather was between -2C to -4C when we reached Mutianyu by 9am.  We booked our MUTIANYU Great Wall adventure with Bus Tour on Klook. We got it on discount. Good for 2 People per set (we bought 5 sets for 10pax at P1,100 if I can still remember. No cable car ride included. We bought it separately from the Tour Guide at RMB 120, prices depends on the season).  We Book Great Wall of China Tour on Klook. Pickup Time is 7am. They will tell you where the nearest pickup point. Make sure to arrive on time. Bring water and snacks.  Travel Time from Downtown Beijing to Mutianyu is two hours.  After the tour, we had lunch in a Chinese Restaurant called Chun Ju Farm House. They served sumptuous and in huge serving. It was worth the money.  Although, there were only five of us who took the cable car and went all the way to the Great Wall Section overall, we had a great time in Beijing.",1,test
"You cannot not see Hagia Sophia when in Istanbul. So do pay a visit. But I'd say don't get your expectations too high. It is a brilliant high done, amazing mosaics but that's really it.

"This place is well worth wandering through. Not only are the old buildings a worthy sight but the Christmas decorations make all the nicer. I would recommend allotting a few hours to explore down the side streets. Some of the houses are stunning and make for a great photograph. Further, by wandering, you stumble upon small pockets of Christmas market which make it all the nicer. Also, the place has a different feeling at day and at night. To make the most of the place, it is worth checking it out during the day and during the night.  We found that buying a ‘jus de pomme chaud’ (a hot apple juice) helped to stave off the cold and made the experience all the more memorable.",1,test
"Incredible, truly impressive! This mosque is famous for its massive dome and the world’s largest building of its kind during its time. Built around 360 and know it took over 200 years to build, Sophia, aka Sofya was the first imperial mosque of Istanbul. The building served different purpose as originally it served as an Orthodox Cathedral, then a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire and then a mosque and now to be a museum. I have seen structures like this in Delhi, the Qutub Minar where it was a Hindu structure, then due to power grabbing, became a mosque. You can tell the difference because a mosque cannot have any images like flowers, people or statues, only calligraphy. At QM, you can see some of the structures were still left with the Hindu remnants. In this place, the guide was narrating the story and I noticed the same where images of the Virgin Mary, the cross and Jesus were still visible on the dome. I mentioned to the guide and asked why it was not covered by the Muslims. He said it was actually covered (not destroyed) and now it is revealed again. So if you look on the dome, there are images of the Virgin Mary All etched in gold. Ahhh history.",1,test

"Suomenlinna is an island just around 30 minutes away from the centre of Helsinki. You cannot buy tickets in advance so you have to do so in a few kiosk ticket machines just outside the ferry pier.  Unfortunately the ticket machines are packed with tourists not really knowing how to work the machines or people with the smarts to buy individually per person on each machine. As a result, it is very easy to miss your ferry even though you are standing in the queue.  I suggest buying your tickets at the kiosks a few hours before you intend to get on the ferry as you could be one of those left behind because some silly tourists were taking ages.  The fortress itself is quite a nice little escapade outside of Helsinki centre. There isn't too much to do apart from wander about and admire the old fortress walls. you could spend a day navigating, having coffee in their few cafes and hoping to meet some of their fortress cats.",1,test
"Suomenlinna is not just a fort, it's a group of islands you can stroll around and enjoy the beautiful coastline and the old buildings in a relaxed atmosphere away from the city.  You get a twelve hour ticket to/from Suomenlinna for the reasonable price of €5. The boat leaves at least once every hour all days of the week. The boat departs from the central market square and tickets are sold in machines by the port. The boat ride takes about 15 minutes and there are seats both inside and on the top deck, nice views of Helsinki and the archipelago!  First thing on the island you find a building which holds bathrooms and a tourist information where you can grab a map of the island. Walking around the island you do for free, you only pay if you wish to visit any of the museums.  You can follow the blue signs across the islands which passes the most important sights and along the way there are information signs about the spots. On a beautiful day you can find many beautiful picknick spots along the coast and just sit and admire the view of the ocean and of Helsinki.  I very much enjoyed my day at Suomenlinna, both seeing and learning about the historic sights and also for the beautiful landscape, the soft rocks by the ocean, the birds and the peacefulness that comes without cars and bars etc. Nice and cheap way to get away from the city stress!",1,test
Mid-October was perfect weather.  Our first visit on this trip was in the evening - few visitors but felt totally safe.  The Cathedral was illuminated making for a nice photo you don't see often.

"One of the greatest and certainly most iconic landmarks of ancient Rome. The amphitheater was  erected in the years 70-72 to 80 CE. by Vespasian and Titus,emperors of the Flavian dynasty.It is a large, elliptical structure 188 m long and 156 m wide, 524 m circumference, 48.5 m high, with a spacious auditorium that could seat to 50,000 spectators. The Colosseum is the largest amphitheatre ever built.  Took place here , inter alia, gladiator fights, naumachie, hunting wild animals. Tradition says that Christians were murdered at the Coliseum, which was commemorated with a cross inside the building. Since the mid-eighteenth century, the Colosseum has been cared for as a place of martyrdom of the first Christians. The place is  steeped in history and  breathtaking. This is a must see venue in Rome.",1,test

I mostly followed by ""blue route"", wandering off the beaten path to walk out to views of the harbor and the city. It was pleasant, even in the winter.  When I arrived (before 10am) the information center was still closed. While there were several signs posted explaining particular places on the island, I think I would have appreciated an audio guide, or maybe a guide with more information than the 1 pages flyer available outside the info center. I'm sure that I didn't appreciate the history of the place as much as I could have.  Getting there and back was easy with the public transport boat from Market Square. I got the ticket from the machine using cash for 5 euros.  It is true that most of the cafes are closed, but there were a few still open, especially closer to the dock.",1,test

The best way to admire this neighborhood is by strolling through the streets and enjoy the half-timbered beautiful homes giving the district an undeniable Charm.  Many attractions are within this area. don't miss Barrage Vauban, ponts converts, Saint Pierre le Vieux Church ....  The name Petite-France (""Little France"")comes from the ""hospice of the syphilitic"" (Hospice des Vérolés, in French), which was built in the late fifteenth century on this island, to cure persons with syphilis, then called Franzosenkrankheit (""French disease"") in German.",0,test

"I cannot, in good conscience, give Hagia Sophia less than 4 stars.  The building is one of the wonders of the world.  However, what a disappointment to visit after its re-conversion.  Although it was reported in July that the coverings over the Byzantine art in Hagia Sophia would be pulled back between prayer times, that is not how it has turned out.  When I visited the Orthodox Christian mosaics in the entryway outside of what is now the prayer hall were uncovered but the most famous mosaic in the apse was covered - all of the sail like curtains which can cover the entire apse were pulled back except for the two that block the view of the virgin and child mosaic in the middle.  I was told afterwards by several people that those will stay that way permanently.  The second floor of the building is now off limits to tourists.  And, of course, the 1500 year old stone floors are covered wall-to-wall in dark green carpet.  The huge disappointment to no longer be able to see the the incredible Byzantine period art in this structure cannot be overstated.  One finds oneself thinking the offending mosaics should be removed and put in a museum.  Very sad.",1,test

We found a private driver to take us to the wall and also to the Ming Tombs via a previous guide - approx. $900RMB and he stayed with us all day. The day was clear and with the snow was memorable. We rode the bus to the village and then the cable car up to the wall at Mutianyu. We walked left (up) for about 4 towers, then walked back (down) by the cable car entrance and continued to the toboggans down. They were very fun however there is a staff person at every turn telling you to slow down. We also stopped in the village at the tea shop for a demonstration and some tea. We had heard the street sellers were obnoxious, but they were fine and it was cold that day, so if you needed a scarf, hat, gloves or sweater you would have been glad they had supplies.",0,test

"Very tourist friendly location to visit the great wall of China. Very well renovated and many options to buy souvenirs and drinks. If you chose to go right, it is one steep climb to the last renovated tower, but it will take a shorter time. If you start going to the left, your endurance will be tested with ups and downs and steps ranging from approx. 5-80cm. The views were stunning during autumn, with all the changing colors. If you are up for a climb, skip the cableway and hike up to the wall (approx. 1 hour). But don’t miss the Taboggan, a slide down from the wall that is fun for any age!!",1,test

"This is one of those sights that you’ve seen a thousand times, but needs to be seen in person. I purchased my ticket (time slot) at the adjacent Roman Forum/Palatine Hill entrance which saved me quite a bit of time standing on line at the Colosseum itself. While I did not go with a guide, I found there were plenty of excellent information plaques throughout the site. Several cases contained treasures found at the site which were nicely displayed and described. I followed a clockwise route starting with the upper level and making my way down. While there were crowds, it was by no means a hindrance to my visit (although I couldn’t imagine the real crowds during peak tourist season, not to mention the heat).",1,test

"The most important thing while our time in China is that Chinese tours arrive at 10am at attractions. This is true for any attraction, of course, there are tour that go to different attractions between the day, but the main and biggest groups will arrive at that time and it is awful. We were in China during late November and early December and avoid all the crowds, but still we observe that at that a 10am the groups will arrive. For the great wall we used the transportation services of Mubus, and they offered buses in the early morning that arrive from around 10am at the wall and anther late service that leaves at noon and arrives before 2pm at the wall. We chose the late option, at the time because we wanted to visit the summer palace in the morning, but once in China it worked perfectly because we avoided the crows at both summer palace and the wall. The Mubus tour guide speaks Chinese and English and will give you a history about the wall as well the options to climb the wall and prices. The do not get any money for the tickets, you simply choose you ticket, give them the money and once at the wall they will buy the tickets for you at the same price, you do not have to make the line. For souvenirs wait until you meet the tour guide back at the restaurant, they have way better prices than the other places we visit. We a try to visit everything by ourselves but the public transportation to the wall was to much hassle and the money saved was not that much when compared to the Mubus price, and your reservation is made without paying the anything from their webpage. Once at the wall, you will have to walk a lot, we chose to take the lift to tower 14 and from that point climb (yes, climb since is only stair step from there) to tower 20. The view from tower 20 is not that great mainly because the walls of the tower itself that are too high, but the steps leading to tower 20 from tower 19 offer a great view. The steps look very step but is very doable, do not worry.",1,test

"Very enjoyable to be honest, plus ticking something off the bucket list.  We opted for the 'at the top' experience, with this being much more expensive but more of a VIP experience and it certainly felt so. There was very little queueing and the 148th floor was much more refined / relaxed. We have two young kids, so did not really want to be waiting around in queues.  It was much quieter and more relaxing on 148th floor, with incredible views. We opted for a 5pm slot so that we could see the sunset and also the first fountain show at 6pm.  We descended to floor 124/125 but did not spend much time there to be honest. The views were not as good and it was much louder / busier.  Overall, quite expensive, but as you are only likely to do it the once then worth it",1,test

We were fortunate to visit just before the Coronavirus struck and therefore the queues were very small",1,test

"Visited Turkey in early March, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  At that time, the virus had not spread to Turkey yet so there was no screening or mask requirements.This was my second time in Turkey and one of the highlights of the trip was the Hagia Sophia.  Words alone cannot convey the feeling of this enormous monument.  Purchased the Istanbul Tourist Pass and the Hagia Sophia was one of the attractions that was included, so no additional ticket fee when visiting.  The short tour was conducted by trained Big Bus staff and lasted about 30 minutes.  Afterwards we were free to explore the rest of the Hagia Sophia, staying as long as we wanted.If you visit in the morning, you may experience beautiful rays of sunlight shining through the exquisite stained glass windows.  The beams lighting up the floor made for great photos.   Note: tripods or selfie sticks of any kind or size are not allowed inside and will be held at security for you until you exit.Enjoy your visit!",1,test

"What's the best way to see St.Mark's glorious interior is to skip the craziness of the hours' long ticketed line to get in for a just a brief tourist's visit?   Mass.  You do not have to be Catholic or even Christian to make a special memory of Venice this way.  In addition to seeing the obvious physical beauty and the age-old traditions of the dedicated faithful, you'll have the advantage of witnessing it all while comfortably seated for just under an hour and savoring some soaring music as well.

"We were in Venice in October and even at that time of year it was crowded.  The day we were in St. Marks Square it flooded, so all those people were then shepherded onto metre-wide raised platforms crossing the square.  We had - fortunately - realised that we could still get around the outside of the square, but I think the rest of the tourists wanted to ""experience"" walking on the platforms over the square!St. Marks Square is very impressive in its size and architecture.  The shops and cafes on the ground floor all around less so.  I was amazed - for example - that restaurants were allowed to have tables and chairs on the actual square itself, whereas if you tried as a tourist to rest your weary bones on the floor of the square you get moved on pretty rapidly!  It was very wet when we were there and there were two restaurants who had canvas awnings extending out into the square in which there was a stage and jazz bands!  Again, the awnings had the effect of ""spoiling"" the racing lines of the buildings and just confirmed in my opinion that St. Marks is more about extracting as many Euro's as possible from as many people as possible.  As with EVERYWHERE in Venice it is a location of extremes.  Extreme beauty and scale and extreme commercialism.  We dd hear a rumour of 20 Euro's for a cup of coffee at one of the cafes around the square...but we certainly weren't going to sit down to find out!",1,test
"We purchased tickets direct from the official site and bought the additional option of a guided tour. It was definitely worth the extra money (€32) to do this and you need to be careful with the cheaper tickets, as you cant access the upper level with them.  The ticket we had (full experience,including English arena), also includes the Palentine Hill and Roman forum,both of which you can see over two days.  With the Coloseum, its a one time visit only and you can only access it at a maximum of 10 minutes before your start time, no more. If you're more than 10 minutes late, after your start time, you could also risk missing out, so arrive well ahead of time.  I can't add any more than people have previously mentioned but is a must do while here.",1,test

"From the moment you step inside this magnificent building you can sense the ‘genie loci’ of this amazing edifice - the layers of history seem to almost lap over you like gentle waves - Do read up about it before hand as to listening to the guide while trying to feel the building itself, can be distracting. tbh for me this building had one of the greatest sense of history in time of almost any other that I have visited - although Glendalough in Ireland could match it, for me, for tearing back the veil of time   * Pre-Book your Museum Ticket and Arrive early - there are queues *",0,test
"If you have the opportunity to visit the Great Wall, this is far and away the best place to see it.  I hired a car and driver on recommendation of colleagues, their advice was good, the driver picked me up on time and took me to a parking area away from the main entrance.  Once you have purchased a ticket (decide whether you wish to travel up on the cable car or toboggan - or permutation of the two) you walk the gauntlet of the tourist shops, burger bars, pizza restaurants etc and arrive at the transit bus stops, the buses run continually so there is rarely a wait.  The transit bus takes you to the base of the hill where you can Catch the cable car or toboggan (I opted for the cable car both ways).  This takes you to almost the base of the wall itself, there is a short climb up some steps to a platform which then has a further steep set of stone steps to the entrance of the wall itself.  You join the wall just below one of the forts, I opted to walk to the right initially and went through two of the forts before coming back and walking to the left, this takes you through some of the forts which lead up the hill winding along the contours of the surrounding land.  The day I went, there was little pollution so the views were fantastic, the wall itself is magnificent.  One thing to be careful of, the steps up to each of the forts can be very steep and difficult to climb up and down of you are physically impared in any way.  One tip - the high steps which lead from the platform to the wall itself are quite difficult to traverse, should you have difficulty climbing them it is twice as difficult to come down them, just to the left of the steps is a small path which goes down to a much easier access, it is marked as ‘Disabled’ but is much easier to get on and off the wall.  I spent about two hours walking up and down with very few people around (it was Easter Monday so a normal working day in China), however on my way back down the hordes were ascending and as is normal in China there is no organisation with people going up one way and down another, it is a free for all with elbows and shoulders every which way.  As I came back down in the cable car the queues to go up were huge and getting longer by the minute, whereas I had walked straight up to the cable car there were now people four deep queueing back several hundred yards.  My advice is go as early as you can and avoid the mid morning rush.  Having said that, it was a fantastic experience which I thoroughly enjoyed.  If you have the good fortune to visit China it is a MUST see.",1,test

"Helsinki is really quite a relatively small capital city if you happen to come from a large city like London and there are, to be honest, not that many tourist sights to see. And they also happen to be quite near to each other and so if you run out of options, a day trip to this island fortress is well worth it. You can go over from the market place by the public ferry rather than pay through your nose with the commercial ferries. I can't remember how much it cost but it was really cheap and the ferry is frequent. We were unlucky as it rained the whole day when we went. Otherwise a day trip on a sunny day would be great. There is a lot to see on the island. Budget for at least 4 hours to truly enjoy the place.",0,test

We were told wrong both times and ended up walking the whole way round and I have mobility issues that are visible. When we got to the ticket office, I thought I'd donned a cloak of invisibility because I was ignored for a few minutes. It was only the fact that I was wearing a face mask that his my look a disbelief that people who work it customer service can be so cold.

I would recommend booking a driver and guide (we used Tour-Beijing) –– it's a 1.5 hour trip from Beijing, and pick-up and drop-off at your hotel is worth paying for. Also, the guide makes the process of getting tickets pretty painless. We took the chairlift up with the idea of riding the alpine slide down, but in the end time was short and the queue was long.

We also visited the At The Top, which is actually on the 124th floor of the tower and is approximately a little more than half way up its total length. From here, we could see across Dubai for many miles in each direction as well as could clearly see the World Islands, which are well off the coast of the city.

"When it's not flooded, it perhaps attracts the most number of tourists in Venice. The Basilica, the tower and the Doge's palace are all places one must definitely visit.  One must get there early in the morning to skip the crowd and long queue to the Basilica. Lots of shops sell jewelry, Murano glass and other stuff. Even though food and refreshments are horribly overpriced, one must enjoy the multiple bands taking turns to play live music in the evenings.",1,test

"Of course you must visit San Marco! If you go early morning, take gum boots because the whole square gets flooded and access is only via planks which get very congested and move slowly. The water clears around 11-12midday. This also houses the very ritzy shopping precinct. Be aware that if you sit anywhere around the square for any form of refreshment or food, you will pay an absolute premium. Some places charge a 6euro cover charge just to walk in! The souvenirs and shops along here (near St Mark's Basilica) are also much more expensive than further along, so be aware of this too.",1,test
"Having heard of this church in history lessons, we thought we had a good idea of what it would be like, but in reality, the sheer scale and history of this place far surpassed our expectations. Having initially been a Christian church for centuries before being converted to a mosque, seeing the unique combination of religious artefacts and frescos of two historically conflicting religions in one place was refreshingly inspiring. The sheer height and scale of a building that was built centuries before modern construction methods was awe inspiring, and to think that many of the actual steps that we walked upon had been used by people nearly a millennia ago. It is definitely an inspirational idea to create it as a museum where any race, creed or person can walk through this magnificent historical artefact. This is a must see.",1,test
"We had Stop over in Beijing and booked tour to great wall. Herbie was our guide . He was waiting on or meeting point and was in sms contact before.

We spend the day at Mutianyu. It was on a friday and suprisingly it wasn't crowded and could enjoy the walk along the wall. We took the option going up on the cable car and down with the slide.

"The Colosseum (Amphitheatrum Novum), built between AD 72-80 !, is the largest amphitheater and an architectural masterpiece. Even though it was a venue for the most cruel and brutal events to entertain and amuse the free inhabitants of Rome, it is still impressive, one of the symbols of the city and shows the architecture of the ancient Romans in antiquity. From the outside, the size is gigantic. 80 entrances, with cellars, trap doors, pulley blocks, elevators and the possibility of flooding the interior for naval battles.  Due to the large number of tourists, it is advisable to book the tour and admission ticket online in advance. An audio guide is very practical. If not booked in advance, there may be long waiting times due to the crowds. Around 12 € entry for the ticket are justifiable all times and worth the entry. The security controls are comparable to those at the airport. Full water bottles and dangerous objects are not allowed!  Sure many tourists but despite of all - a must-see and one of the dominant buildings and sights in Rome",0,test

The best thing to do is to go for overnight stay in nearby boutique hotels . That will make the trip worth the while.",0,test

"While some of it was under construction during my visit the old church/mosque is magnificent! If history is your thing make sure to make a wish with your thumb in the pillar, see the Viking graffiti and old the old mosaics in gold are stunning! I have mixed feelings about the audio guide - there aren't very many plaques around explaining the history of the place to rely on otherwise - but the layout of the audio guide is a mess and the information is a bit hit and miss - given that you have to pay for it anyways perhaps getting a proper guide - of which there are plenty around -  is another good option to look into?",0,test

So stunning! So scenic! Gorgeous!!  And such a pleasure to enjoy the ride!!  The boat is gorgeous and a pleasure to board and the ride was so so much fun!!  It was so worth it!!  The staff is so professional!!  Within less than a half an hour, I enjoyed the view, the sea, the breeze and the staff and observed the inner workings of the boat.  To go to Mt.

The boats are economical, at about $15 per person.  The tour goes all over Strasbourg and gives fabulous views.  The boats have a narration in a lot of different languages by tapping into a sound system with headphones.  Everything was clean and well run.  Boats left about every 30 minutes.  Stellar tour of a beautiful city.",0,test

"It is absolutely absurd Constantine. Once I was revived into the 21st century, I visited Rome and heard of your deeds. All is lost. My efforts.. My hope. My empire. Everything that I had ever worked for has been for nothing. You must understand that I did not break the edicts of 303 - 304 for no reason. Yes I understand, from your perspective I looked like a cruel and harsh leader, but give me a chance to look at it differently will you. My miserliness and cruelty was only due to the fact that I loved the empire, and I wanted the empire to prosper. Why else do you think I put an end to domestic anarchy, why else would I defeat the revolt in Gaul of Bagaudae. My persecutions were the SAME. I did it so Rome would not fall from that country-ending religion. But one man… One man ruined it all. CONSTANTINE. ANSWER ME. Why did thee issue the Edict of Milan? The Edict of Milan allowed the rise of that despicable religion, which eventually resulted in the fall of Rome. How you ask? How else? With your edict of Rome ending the persecutions of the Christians, you also ended the traditional Roman values system. The polytheistic Roman religion was displaced, thus the emperors were no longer as divine as they were. Furthermore the glory was no longer of the state but rather their deity. It also complicated the governance as popes and church leaders also took an increased role in political affairs. THINK CONSTANTINE. THINK. A MERE CLOUD THE SHAPE OF A CROSS IS NOT A SIGN.",0,test

With no cruise ships and increasing quarantines, now is the time to take a risk and get to Venice, in case they shut Italy down again. Space and time to do the perfect thing, spend a few extra Euros on a sunset cocktail at Cafe Florian and escape into a Renaissance world of beauty for a short while.",1,test

The surrounding skyscrapers are architecturally amazing and the water features below are beautiful. The tower acts as a backdrop for a light show when the Dubai Fountain show takes place.

"You expect lots of people of course and that is the one thing that will not be a surprise. The numbers are boosted by huge swathes of cruise ship sightseers and trippers. The place is quite frankly rather shabby. No seats anywhere - so not good for those with mobility issues or the infirm, but that is true of Venice as a whole. You can sit down at one of the cafes where you will be openly and royally ripped blind. If you are sad enough to think having an average coffee and cake for 30 euros whilst sat on a hard metal chair and served by at best indifferent and at worst hostile waiting staff is some kind of experience, then this is the place for you. The best value are a couple of sandwich and ice cream shops around the arcade walks. Apart from Caffe Florian, the other cafes were practically empty apart from an American family who were eating ice creams and told to vacate the otherwise empty chairs they used at an otherwise empty cafe. You could not make it up really. Beware the thieves and pickpockets - of all nationalities - and be also aware you are not allowed to sit on any of the steps as the - I kid you not - 'Respect Venice' hi-vis herberts will tell you off. Unfortunately Venice and its politicans and bureaucrats have no respect for the likes of us great unwashed visitors. They do like your money though!  Apart from all that I still just don't see the fuss. If you have to go once and then explore the rest of Venice which is more attractive and more interesting.",1,valid

I was visiting in February before covid got serious. We knew were too go and how to get our tickets (we are very organised and can read maps) and every information helper at least 12 the short space of time kept asking us for help. We said ""no thanks"" and one replied ""looks like you haven't a clue"" and another said ""if don't get to help your only going to get lost"" at this stage we were right near the ticket collection at stand.. Just really spoils it all and they should be trained too be abit more polite and accept people don't want or may not want help. Overall the visit was amazing. It would be 5 stars but those information helpers were so rude and annoying.",0,valid

It is now a Unesco world heritage site and is popular among locals for picnics and strolls.

On reaching the top you can go  left or right, the left is the easier of the 2 options  we spent about 1 1/2 hours on the wall the views are magnificent  if the weather's good. You have 2 options to go down ,the cable car or the tobboggan  which you will have to buy tickets for before you go up.there is a souvenir  shop just before the cable car but it is quite expensive  for cold drinks a 600ml bottle of beer cost about 80 yuan but worth it  on a hot day",0,valid

We booked ahead if time and received login details for vox guide to download onto our phones which was good. Worth investigating.,0,valid

You get up to the MuTianYu section by cable car or ski lift, and you come down by the same means, or by dry-run toboggan! But to stand on that legendary wall, to walk part of the length of it, to see the extent of even a tiny part of it is something not be missed. We were among very few visitors that day, and the solitude, the silence and the atmosphere of the place contributed to the wonder and the sense of history. How it was built is beyond comprehension.  You have to go there!",1,valid

"Without a doubt, a beautiful and imposing place with many impressive buildings and great architecture. Characterized by the facade of St. Mark's Church (Basilica di San Marco), enclosed by the old and new procuracies, extending through the Piazzetta, it extends to the Doge's Palace and opens there to the water.  But also very crowded with tourists. There is no seating, only in the cafes or restaurants. However, these are very expensive - up to 20 euros for a coffee. I think that's crazy.  Must have seen once, for sure. The canals and waterways, no cars, great architecture. But for me none of the top 10 highlights in Europe. Rome was more impressive, for me",1,valid
If you are planning to visit burj khalifa with your friends or family or relatives .. i suggest to go in evening. The lighting crowd view scenery restaurants or cafe everything looks spectacular.

I vistited the Burj khalifa from an area outside the Dubai mall and indeed snapped pictures. this building is one of the main sight seeing sites of the city of Dubai and at the foot of the building lies the Dubai fountain plus the magnificent Dubai mall.

"My 1st visit to South Beach was because of an Eagles game but my next visit will be to take in the whole South Beach experience.  We stayed by the airport but had the opportunity to visit for a day and the mini-trip was Spectacular!!  For example,The Clevelander South Beach was great for crowd watching...the Venice Island-like promenade was a neat walking trip...the weightlifting set up on the beach was interesting to see...the crowds, the food smells, the noise...all of it was Cool!!  We ended up at the beach in front of the Fontainebleau and were treated to waiter service with our feet in the ocean...Incredible!!  And, we weren't even there for the nightlife...:)  Alright looking forward to the next trip to South Beach to do it all.",1,valid
"It is definitely worth the walk you take along the streets tucked away in the glory and majesty of Venice! The view is  just on-point and you really dont wanna walk back.

"We spent a lot of time in Piazza San Marco or St Marks Square on our 5 day trip to Venice. The architecture, restaurants, shops and people make it a perfect spot to stop, grab a drink and relax. All the restaurants service nuts chips and Small’s bits when you order a drink. You can stay at long as you like and watch the action happening throughout the piazza.  This is also a very famous spot for photos however it gets VERY crowded so if you want a photo without many people go very very early. Be sure to bring bread crumbs or seeds if you want to feed the hundreds a of hungry birds roaming around. Definitely a great spot to relax and take in the beauty of Venice!",1,valid
"There is something about the old quarters that draws you in despite the constant honking, crazy traffic, pavements barely available and people buzzing past in a constant frenzy. I think it is the unique character of the place that can be associated with the Old Quarters. It is fun staying in this area and eating out can be a traditional experience. This is further made unique with the rickshaws that ply around the area. A must see if one wants to understand Hanoi better.",1,valid
"The vast expanse of Venice's largest square is brought together and made to seem almost intimate by the elegant uniformity of its architecture on three sides. But more than its architectural grace, St. Mark's Square (Piazza San Marco) is loved as Venice's living room, the place everybody gathers, strolls, drinks coffee, stops to chat, meets friends and tour guides, or just passes through on the way to work or play. Three sides are framed in arcades, beneath which are fashionable shops and even more fashionable cafés. The open end is bookmarked by the erratic, exotic curves, swirls, mosaics, and lacy stone filigree of St. Mark's Basilica. Above it towers the brick shaft of the campanile. For overviews of this busy piazza, you can go to its top or to the top of the Torre dell'Orologio, where a pair of ""Moors"" strikes the hour.",0,valid
"Dubai is built on its premise of giving you spectacular views everywhere you go but there is no view better than that at the top of the Burj Khalifa , Dubai’s cio IV and flagship skyscraper which has inspired countless imitations and even a movie. The views don’t disappoint, take your time to chill at the top, take hundreds of photos you’ll never look at again and pick up some souvenirs as well. This is by far one of the best things to do in Dubai, but the experience of going up in the elevator and understanding the sheer effort and man hours it took to build are as important as the amazing views at the top.",1,valid

"What happened to South Beach? It use to be so classy. Now, it’s straight up trashy. Ocean drive is a disgrace. Boarded up businesses. Goodbye high end retailers, hello Surf Style t-shirt shops on every corner, bad food, marijuana clouded boardwalk and streets.

"We had spent a day on our feet in hot weather all over Lucerne and by the end of the afternoon we needed a break. A boar ride on Lake Lucerne with cool breezes and a cold drink was just what we needed.

"Wow, it really took great courage to cross the busy noisy streets here, fighting our way through a sea of motorcyclists:)  No looking back once you decide to cross.  Like reviewers said, they'd zig-zag around you and you'd be totally untouched!It was a real experience, walking along the colourful streets lined with street food stalls, people perched on low stools.  We enjoyed some street food like pho gia, ban cuon, goi cuon and nem, King Roti too.  As advised by some TA members, we went where locals go.  Taste of food was good everywhere.Shopping at Old Quarters could be challenging.  There're lots of fake branded goods which outwardly look like the real thing (internally it's a slightly different story).  The prices vary from store to store.  They could start with 700,000 dong and finally agree with 300,000 dong even.  It was fun haggling.It being Tet Festival, prices of food was higher.  Good thing it was not difficult to find food at all.  Most restaurants were open.If coming to Hanoi, Old Quarters is surely a must-visit.",1,valid
"Hagia Sophia is an enormous architectural marvel that was built nearly 1,500 years ago. It combined design elements of an Orthodox basilica with a large, doomed roof, semi circular altar.  Words cannot describe the feeling this place gives me. When you take your first step inside, you instantly hit by the sheer weight of history for this monumental structure. Its unbelievably beautiful and a humbling experience to see something monumental that withstood the test of time.  We were very fortunate to visit in early October 2020. Because of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, we got to really enjoy out experience since there was very little tourist and it seems that we had the whole place to ourselves.  Please take not of the prayers times. Also there are tourist guide offering their services outside at a fee.",1,valid

"Went with my daughter. She couldn’t wait to get to this beach. No parking anywhere. No toilets anywhere on the beach. There was a man that said he worked on the beach, I asked him where the nearest toilet was and he said a 15 minute walk to the gas station! But he suggested I urinate in the water “like the fishes do”. I didn’t see any lifeguards. Outside of that, the beach was clean, there was social distancing and working showers.",1,valid
"Our top thing to do in Luzern. Although quite expensive (we took a boat trip to Vitznau and back), it was worth it. We were very lucky to sail on a clear and beautiful day in June but I'm sure the lake would still be gorgeous regardless. Also great to walk around it and enjoy the landscape from the little beaches dotted about. The view of Mt Pilatus from the lake is just something you don't forget in a hurry. Definitely up there as one of my favourite lakes, my photos do not do this justice.",0,valid

"This is a fabulously scenic little town. Obviously it is the tourist highlight of Strasbourg. Many small cobbled streets and bridges pass over the River I’ll and all provide magnificent scenes through to medieval style houses/restaurants etc being the old tanneries etc of the area. It is largely pedestrians only with few cars allowed in the area. Certainly tends to get very busy with tour groups all over the place  Le Petite e France (also known as the Quartier des Tanneurs; German: Gerberviertel; ""Tanner's Quarter"") is a historic quarter of the city of Strasbourg in eastern France. It is located at the western end of the Grande Île, which contains the historical centre of the city. At Petite France, the River Ill splits up into a number of channels that cascade through an area that was, in the Middle Ages, home to the city's tanners, millers and fishermen, and is now one of Strasbourg's main tourist attractions. Petite France forms part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Grande Île, designated in 1988.[1][  A simply magical place where the camera cannot be put down.",1,valid

We waited in line for the elevator for around 45 minutes and when at the top it was a lovely view. There is only one small retrace on 124th floor and then it takes you straight into the gift shop. We then had to wait nearly 2 hours to get back down which was absolutely horrendous. We came during the pandemic so tourism was quiet so I dread to think was it will be like in the height of the season. I wouldn't recommend going up the tower and paying all that money. You can get some amazing shots from the bottom or other high rise buildings.,0,valid

"Had it not been for the colony of bed bugs that overtook us on December 26, our review would have been a 5-star one in the context of the hotel's official 3-star rating. The location is superb, the young staff was cheerful and attentive and the rooms though small were manageable. Unfortunately, due to the bed bug invasion, this episode left us visiting the Emergency Ward of a local hospital and generated a lot of work on the part of the staff and ourselves in eradicating the intruders. The hotel did change our room but relocated us immediately next door which did concern us. They also laundered all our belongings and paid for dry cleaning of some garments. However, we were astounded to hear the hotel manager suggest that we were responsible for bringing the bugs with us. Upon returning home, we contacted Accor Hotels to ask for some compensation on two separate occasions (using their website feed-back form) but received no response in the three months that since ensued. This is unfortunate since we have using Ibis hotels for well over 20 years, often annually, and could not even merit a reply one way or another. Further, this was a two-week stay, over the X-mas period, that marred our holiday including the fact that it generated unforeseen expenses.  We are both seniors. Any compensation would have demonstrated good will.",1,valid

It was a nice experience. The guide was knowledgeable and it was less crowded on the 148th. Go up about 5 pm to have time to get up and see the sunset. You can also see the fountain display that starts at 6 pm. I went up at 4 and it was too long of a wait for the sunset and fountains.",1,valid

"To get here from Beijing you'll need to take a tour bus for several hours depending which part of the city you are travelling from since the traffic can be crazy in China and often is. Once the bus drops you off and you pay for your ticket to go through, you'll need to climb up a hill which takes about a half hour to get up, passing through trees and up wooden steps, hopefully you wont mind bugs flying into your ears. Once you reach the top of the hill you see the wall blocking your view, then you can go up some steps and you'll finally see a wall that seems to go on forever. It slides up and down the hills, like a snake almost as it twists and turns in both directions on and on; on a clear day you can see it stretch out, but be careful of when you visit because it can get unbearably hot in China, up to 40 degrees Celsius. You'll also need to make sure that you're visiting when few other people are because otherwise you'll be cramped in with hundreds of others beside you and barely able to move or enjoy the wall. You can run up and down the sloping wall, explore the small castles dotted along, see old cannons and behold northern China, aka Inner Mongolia and experience a piece of history. To get back down you don't need to walk, you can simply take a sled down a long slide for a fun 5 minutes back down to the bottom.",1,valid

"BUDGET.  Flights– buy your tickets early! The sooner you can buy them the better. There is even a day called Cyber Monday where you can try to get tickets at a price that will leave you in shock. I found tickets to Rome a few years ago on Cyber Monday for 130.! Yes, that is not typical, but it can be done.  Another tip for cheap flights is flexibility! Flexible on your dates, times, and even destinations! I have seen flights to Paris for 300. and flying from Paris to Rome can be as cheap as 50. Euro’s so flexible when looking for tickets! You must outsmart the airlines and that can be time-consuming and difficult, but it is possible.  The next tip is using the best ticket search engines. I will tell you upfront that these change from one year to the next. The best ones I use are Kayak, Momondo, Skyscanner, Hip monk, and Airfare watchdog.  Another trick I use is to use the website to find the cheapest flights and then go directly to the airline website and see if they have a better fare. United airlines are good for this. I have twice found better fares on their website when booking travel.  I know this goes against the whole Firefly principle, but if you find a fare that is close to your budget, go to your local travel agent in town and ask them if they can find a better fare. Sometimes they can get a better deal on a block of seats they already negotiated a low price for. Be aware you will be bombarded with offers for entire tours. (not my thing)  Check surrounding cities' airports. Sometimes flights are cheaper to a smaller airport. Make sure you know the transportation cost. (do not forget when the trains or busses stop running at night). Also, sign up for newsletters for the airlines. They have flash sales all the time and will give you the cheapest fares, but this again is all about flexibility.  Good deals found can range from 400 to 600 per person.",1,valid

"We visited Mutianyu Great Wall on October 29, no much crowd and the ride on the cable and down by the luge was smooth. From the main entrance to the cable car station take about 8 minutes walk.  We were told not to patronize the stall up in the great wall and it is true, they charged much more than the stores at the base.  A cup of coffee (instant mixed) cost CNY45!   On the whole, the beautiful view up at the great wall is worth all the walk.",0,valid

"the air was clean, the sky clear and perfect for the 21/2 hour walk up and down the great wall. it was a thrill, so glad I went",1,valid
"I went to Mutianyu taking the Mubus which was very convenient. Its an uphill slope to get to the cablecar and chairlift but you get nice views as you walk. I expected the place to be filled with just a handful of people since people kept telling me that only foreigners go to Mutianyu and its really few people. Its definitely not crowded like Badaling but there are crowds at various areas of the wall itself and also around the base of Mutianyu. I feel like the place is becoming more popular with the locals too. Not that it is a bad thing.  After you reach tower 14 and go up that short stairs to get on the wall itself, you can turn left to go up to tower 20 or turn right to tower 6 and lower. My cousins went to tower 20 while I decided that I could not leave the place without taking the toboggan and also my legs were dead after the stairs at Summer Palace and more stairs everywhere else. Tower 14 to 6 is a breeze. Its easy, the steps are really low and wide and not tiring at all. Of course the views aren’t as spectacular as the ones you get at the higher towers but its still not too shabby. Its mostly stairs or slope going down with just 2 or 3 stairs going up which are nothing difficult at all. With really tired legs, I managed it quite easily. The entrance to the toboggan was at the side of the wall and very easy to miss. So you need to watch out for it if that is your aim. I think it was on the right as you come down from tower 14. And the sign at the small opening says ‘Shopping Area’ and ‘ Great Wall Footpath’. Go down the stairs and turn left and its on your right after a small cafe or souvenir shop. The ride is very safe. You actually have to push the lever down alot and with strength if you wish to accelerate. If you dont touch the lever at all, it wont move. You have their staff standing every few metres to watch out for you in case anything happens and mostly they are telling people to slow down or to be quicker since there’s no problem with the ride. Its about 10mins for me since I didnt go exactly very fast. When you start, they let you go in batches. And they flag you off one by one to create a safe distance with each person.  I love the ride so much that I want to go back to Mutianyu just for the ride. I will take the chairlift to tower 6 and take the toboggan down.",1,valid
"My first trip to China and I am very happy we chose to visit Mutianyu Great Wall.  We took Mu Bus to reach the wall and I HIGHLY recommend using it for transportation to and from Beijing.  We had perfect fall weather with blue skies and beautiful trees.  Our guide on Mu Bus advised us to take cable car up and down from the wall.  The cable car brings you to gate 14 and we hiked to gate 20 which was strenuous.  The tobaggon slide is at gate 6 so hiking 14-20 and then back to gate 6 will be a lot to handle.  There is a delicious Chinese food restaurant near bus parking area.  A warning to use restroom before getting on the Wall.  There is a cafe to sit and get cold or hot drinks after cable car drops off, very expensive but great cappuccino.",1,valid
"We haven’t been to Miami Beach in several years and were really looking forward to our visit.  After this trip, we will NEVER be back. The entire South Beach area has been taken over by thuggish 20-somethings openly smoking dope on the streets, barely clothed, and screaming obscene language in public, both day and night.  We frequently ran into large groups that blocked building entrances where they gathered, yelling to be heard over their stereos and one another.  They made no effort to share the sidewalks and store aisles, or to respect other visitors.  The screeching, roaring Bentley’s and Ferrari’s raced up the main streets with rap music blasting until 3:30 or 4:00 am. each night, waking us repeatedly in our 5th-floor hotel room.  We are so glad that our children were not here with us because there were a lot of offensive images and terrible behaviors.  It’s sad to see this significant decline in South Beach. The City needs to get a serious handle on this problem.",0,valid

The Romans, either from the West or from the East, knew how to build ! Byzantium will remain in history, and in the collective memory, as one of the greatest civilizations that world has ever seen. Too bad, that no more monumental buildings from the Byzantine period, have been preserved.",1,valid

From the moment you enter the Burj Khalifah on the ground floor to the anticipation that builds when waiting for the lift, and when ascending to the viewing decks in an eerie ambient setting in the dark lift with nothing but the screen counting the floors rising you await with excitement and roughly a minute after entering the doors open letting in steaks of sunlight drawing you closer to the viewing glass. You will not be dissapointed. You get to walk around the viewing platform swinging from inside to outside taking in the full scope of the land from all sides. Catch it on a less hazy day and you can see beyond far into the dunes. A little conveniently placed gift shop is also available although over priced there are some decent gifts.

We stayed in Old Quarter for just a couple of days but what a pleasantly unexpected surprise the great food and people were.  And to watch all the traffic maneuver around each other - what an amazing thing!!! Almost like a ballet and synchronized swimming mixed together.,1,valid
You haven’t been to Istanbul if you haven’t visited the Hagia Sophia. Reasonable price to see stunning and unique architecture. We didn’t go for the audio guide option but there were plenty of information cards around so it’s totally fine to visit it alone,0,valid
Great view of lake from Mt Pilatus on a clear day. We took a paddle wheel boat from Aplnachstad to Lucerne and was scenic but not worth the CH27.00 it cost us each.,0,valid
"Review for Colosseum + Underground tour: Not worth it for €33. First, you have to wait for only 1 specific time and date since it's not offered often. 5 days before the tour, I get an email saying that they accidentally sold us tour before the opening of the park. No problem for me. On the day, I got to skip the long ticket line, and since the time change, I had to go to another booth inside and change my ticket. Then I waited with another person, and our tour guide was late by 15-20 minutes! Fine, we go on the tour and we first go through the underground/gladiator part. The whole part is literally 10 minutes only. You get to see a tiny section of it and that's all. The worst part is that during the regular tour part, she reminded us twice that she has another tour to give, so we have to speed things up a bit. That was disrespectful and rude on her part to force us to do it faster since she was the one late. But the Colosseum was nice to visit. It's always crowed unless you're exactly at 10am. Recommend to do it by another company.",1,valid
"The history, the tour... excellent.   Pay extra to not stand in line and get the VIP tour.   Totally worth every penny.",0,valid
"Absolutely stunning! We visited two days ago, and luckily the weather was not too bad, with a temperature of 7°C. There were no crowds and one could stroll at their leisure. Everything still had a bit of a white sprinkle over it, making the wall even more spectacular - having said that, no trip to China would be complete without visiting the wall.  We took the shuttle as it does seem as quite a distance to walk uphill, approx 3km.  The cable car was also a wonderful experience.",1,valid
"Wonderful tour of the Colosseum and its dungeons led by a Viatour guide named Dennis. There were about 20 people on our tour.  He took time to communicate with each of us.  He was very knowledgeable, patient and gave delightful commentary.  It was one of the highlights of my trip !",0,valid
Amazing building with rich history from when the Romans were defeated by the Ottomans and the church was converted to a mosque. Such magnificent architecture even for today’s standards. A definite must see for any one visiting Istanbul.,0,valid
"Absolutely stunning place. as i had short time i used cable car. but hiking is highly recommended, buy your ticket online beforehand.",0,valid
"Beautiful architecture, always a classic in Dubai. Impossible to visit the city and not see the tower. Once, you need to go up and see the beautiful views of Dubai!",0,valid
"A lovely way to go sight seeing and you see things you wouldn't see otherwise. It's also a pleasant break from doing everything on foot. Well worth the money. The boats are pretty comfy, offering refreshments for sale and bathrooms. This was half price with  the half fare card",1,valid

"I took my Grandson on a surprise visit to Italy and Rome was our number one spot! Ive been to Rome 3 times before but never inside the colosseum,this I wanted to share with one of my grandchildren.  My 14yr old grandson,like myself was blown away! You cant help but lose yourself to the history of the architecture of this beautiful place! You can only imagine the lower levels of the animals and Gladiators that walked these foundations! On the first level ,there is a gift shop and a museum of artifacts and history and conception of the Colosseum itself! Wear good shoes as the stairs leading up to the levels are steep! How they done it in their time astounds me! Its best to buy your tickets on the website..before you leave for Italy, it can save you time in waiting in the queue.  But if rather buy your tickets once there..the ticket office is right beside the colosseum,its very easy to find. We didnt have a guide ,but there are guides available.  Take with you sun shade and water ..there is a water on ""tap"" from one of the natural springs you can fill your bottle with.  I will return again and take another Grandchild...you can never get board of this historic place as each time you will find something new to enlighten you. Even at my age I am still learning!",1,valid
It’s an amazing global landmark.... but not the most user friendly.  So here are a few considerations:  wear good walking/hiking shoes.... the steps can be steep and irregular.   Plan on about a 1.5 mile hike on the wall (after the gondola ride and turn right heading to return “slide”.).....you will encounter a variety uphill and downhill terrain....but more downhill and less tiring on your legs....bring water to keep hydrated-no services on the wall or restrooms except at “slide” station (where you can enjoy a beer with spectacular views).....Hopefully you don’t mind getting up early to get out Beijing and get to the site early in the day.... say leave by 8am at the latest to arrive by 10an to avoid the arrival of large tour buses.  There didn’t seem to be much variation in walking the Great Wall... the towers seem to be relatively similar and no historical displays are found inside....It is a marvel to imagine the construction of the Great Wall with basic tools and its durability.....The terrain at this location is impressive too....The “slide” is fun and a quick ride down to the base station....Plenty of souvenir shops and food await your return,1,valid
Enjoy your walk here ! Take your time and plenty of photos. There are also nice restaurants and places to eat and drink.,1,valid
"This is one of my favorite places in Helsinki; I drag anyone who comes to visit me here, and I frequently go here on my own. There are a few boutique museums on the island, as well as cafes (though the cafes aren't usually open except summer).  Reminder: This is part of HSL, so you can use your day passes on here.",1,valid
"Visited here for the second time last spring and first time getting a proper full day. You can get a return ferry ticket nowadays for just €5 and the Island was beautiful and surprisingly quiet when we went. It's a combination of nature and history and really it's just a nice place to go for a walk. There are food options, although many places were closed as the season hasn't started. Had a couple of beers at the brewery which were seasonal and tasty. If you've got the time, it's definitely worth the trip, especially on a sunny summer afternoon when you're looking for a place with a breeze!",1,valid

We walked all around the area of La Petite France. Great little island surrounded by the river. Lots of bars & restaurants.,1,valid
Surreal visit with no crowds! Watch out for the people hassling your to buy queue free tickets as a con and not worth the extra money. They even hassle you in your very small queue at the official ticket office!!! Did not take away from the awe inspiring sights to behold.,0,valid
A very nice section of the Great Wall. Not too far from the city. Steep steps leading up to the proper walk on the wall. Several restaurants between parking an wall. You can also use a chair lift to go up (imnstead of the cable car) and go down on a sldge.,1,valid
We loved the Colosseum however were very disappointed by how filthy it was.  I am so disappointed by the lack of respect that tourists and tourist operators have for this beautiful structure.  We were distressed to see tour bus operators throw all of the rubbish from their tours out onto the streets around the area.  As our hotel was located a short walk from the Colosseum we witnessed this practice day after day. The cost of entry into the Colosseum is also reasonalble compared to that of other tourist destinations in Rome.  Overall we loved the experience however would like to see people treat the area with more respect.,1,valid
We were here in December during the highest predicted tides for month.  Many had told us to cancel our trip but we did not encounter any flooding in the city even though it rained the entire time. We even got to see snow flurries. We had a wonderful uncrowded visit the pigeons were not even out on the day we visited.  Just beware of when southerly winds and astronomical tides are predicted to co occur.   In summary it probably floods less than Charleston SC.,0,valid

"Visited the Colosseum during out trip in Rome as we considered it a “must do”. However the whole experience was very disappointing. First of all, it was an adventure to book the tickets. Due to the ongoing Covid pandemic, the ticket office is closed but there is no sign anywhere to highlight that. Furthermore, there are plenty of signs pointing towards a nonexistent “ticket office “ and, as a result, people are going around in circles trying to find it. After doing so ourselves, we discovered a tourist information point near the underground station and we went in full of hope and found out the tickets can only be bought online. After a few failed attempts we went back and we were told to “keep trying “.  Later on, I found this app called Parco Colosseo and managed to book the tickets this way. We paid 18 E for a non guided tour that included level 2 and a small part of level one, also 1 entry to the Roman Forum. They had no English audio guides available, everything was offered in Italian only. Definitely not worth it.  Overall, we have seen more from the free spots outside, there are some excellent viewing points outside the Roman Forum that are completely free.  Although I appreciate the difficulties of the “new reality “ we live in, I found most staff to be clueless and rather rude and the whole experience frustrating.  It may be worth paying for a private tour organised via a different agency, not the Colosseum Park .",1,valid

"A World Heritage Site! You can reach Suomenlinna by ferry and is about 15 minutes from the mainland. The ferry leaves every hour. This is one of the places that is included FREE with your Helsinki card.  Suomenlinna is a sea fortress consists of four islands connected by bridges. Then you dock, the info center is right in front of the dock. That is the main island and the tourists can first explore that island if you do not have much time. The other two to the right, well the first one has some old bunkers and cannons to see but the second island that is connected with the second island, there is really nothing to see there. That is the place where the employees of the island maintain residence and it is private. In the main island, you can spend the entire day, visit the church, military museum, the old church, have ice cream at the ice cream parlour, eat lunch at some of the restaurants, enjoy a pint at the brewery, maritime museum or watch the King’s gate drawbridge and many other tiny museums. There is also a tunnel towards the end opposite the King’s Gate to the right. If you decide to buy some ice cream or any other food at the tiny grocery in the main island next to the ferry dock station, beeeeee careful with the sea gulls. They will come and attack the food away from your hands. You can spend an entire day here. The island itself is a World Heritage site listed as an 18th century sea fortress with artilleries and defensive walls. Wear a good pair of walking shoes. The cobblestones are very uneven and you can easily twist your ankle.",1,valid
"The Lake Lucerne divides Lucerne in half. One half - with a Central Train Station and the ""New"" Town. The other half - with the Old Town. There are many boats (even in January) taking tourists for a sightseeing short cruises around the lake. One of many ""postcard"" towns in beautiful Switzerland with a beautiful and clean lake.",0,valid
"As long as the weather is somewhat reasonable, go here for sure! We went on a perfectly clear sunny day in July. Take the reasonably priced ferry ride to the island and make sure you get off at the right island. The ferry makes other stops too! I recommend to spend your time on the bigger size of the island which has the forts. You can do museums and churches back in Helsinki. We had teenage kids with us and we cut them lose to explore on their own and they just loved it! We also had a great time exploring the forts. Take your time and explore. Some of the views are amazing. Have coffee, vino, cake at Piper and sit outside up the hill for a fantastic view. I also highly recommend the Italian pizza restaurant which is inside a tavern. Great food and experience. Also, it is not as expensive as the nearby Walhalla restaurant. We also had softies near the ferry station which was also nice.",1,valid

"We spent a glorious, early summer, sunday afternoon on the island in company with many locals enjoying picnics on the grasss in the sunshine. An interesting place with lots to see, cafes and restaurants. We travelled by ferry, an enjoyable 15 minute trip, using a Helsinki Transport day ticket. Cost 8 euros and can be used on trams, buses and ferries. One word of caution however. The island is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is in its original state. Consequently the roads and pathways, being paved with the original cobbles and stone pavers, are uneven and may prove difficult for those who are not sure of their steps",1,valid
"The boat ride on Lake Luzern can be relaxing, especially if you have spent considerable time walking around the town.  There were audio devices available, but after trying to find one that would function properly, several of them, I gave up on the narration and decided to enjoy the scenery.   Taking photos is sometimes a challenge, because some passengers have no concerns about jumping in front of you without warning.  Persistence is the key.",0,valid

Michael was a perfect tour guide. We booked a basic tour package to include transportation and admission. He gave information about the Great Wall on the bus and allowed ample opportunity to explore.

Highly recommend this tour.,0,valid

"This island fortress is only a 20 min ferry ride from the Helsinki marketplace , and costs 5 euros for a day ticket . It is a place for long walks and interesting sights, museums and history . If you are elderly , can’t do long walks , you can try booking the Taksi Viapori , which is a partly motorised tricycle , driven by a very knowledgeable driver . This is more expensive but worth every cent . You can do a 45 min or a 90 min trip . There are plenty of eating places on the island, or you could take a picnic .

"My first time visiting this beach and was not disappointed at all. This beach goes on for kilometers, and is probably 400 meters wide. No wonder this is one of those spring break destinations, as I dont think you could run out of room. Additionally, the beach has a good vibe that is both family friendly and adult friendly. While I dont think this is a clothing optional beach, there were many women topless on the beach. As for the sand, it is fine, and not rocky at all, and their is no garbage whatsoever. The water is clear and clean and great for swimming. I can see why this is a must visit place while in miami",0,valid

When we went in December 2020 we had the wall pretty much to ourselves. To get here we hired a local guide that picked us up from our hotel and bought all of our tickets. This included a cable car ride up and the slide down. The slide is fun but the awkward positioning hurt my groin a bit.  There are some shops up here but most of them close during the winter it seems. There is a wild (original) section of the wall here that is very easy to see! One of the many highlights of the trip included these two cats that followed us through a couple of the towers!,1,valid

"Living close to the lake we've seen it in storms, sunshine, snow, night, and day and many combinations in between. Regardless of the weather, there are always sites and sounds to explore.  During the summer time and even into fall, there are a number of areas for swimming, paddle boarding, renting a very small boat and exploring, as well as taking the ""cruise boats"" for exploring the lake.  During the winter the lake is a bit cold for my taste for swimming, but you can still take a cruise which could include lunch or dinner depending upon what is available.  Best thing to do (in my opinion) is to hit the websites for Luzern and see what is going on during your visit. The tourist information office located at the main train stations is always helpful as well.",0,valid
Cool place to walk around and take a picnic. We didn’t pay to see any of the museums but the Customs Museum is free and has a cool exhibit on about sniffer dogs right now that we really enjoyed. It just happened to be the 200th anniversary of the Guard Band so we were treated to a military parade which was very cool.,0,valid

It’s amazing when you read about it in history books but once you see it you remain breathless. You just have to see it. Too bad they’ve turned it into an active mosque and some of the walls are covered to conceal Christian symbols. But biggest bugger is that you can’t see the floors anymore but a few square meters as there’s carpet on it.  Anyway. Still worth a visit.,0,valid

Those that weren't cleared had very obvious warning signs on them, and looked treacherous. We were able to walk all the way across the islands and back. The main museums were open, and the cafes. Definitely worth a visit, even in winter, but be ready for the cold winds off the sea.",0,valid
"We just love the entire area around the Burj Khalifa!  There is a park, there is a lake with a fountain show, there are walking paths, and there's a mall (if you're not into the nature-stuff).  It's truly a beautiful place to visit.  And if you're up for the adventure, try going to the observatory high in the sky!",1,valid
"The history here is very interesting, learning about the different ownership of the fortress and what it has been used for in the past. But more so I found the quaint, untouched nature of the island extremely beautiful. The boat from Helsinki is €5 return and only takes 15 minutes - it’s so worthwhile.",1,valid
Was amazed by the splendid view and the spirit of chinese people; parents with little children and old people climbing the stairs; simply wonderful,0,valid
A must-see. You can’t visit Roma without seeing the Colosseum. Excellent value for money and never too busy judging from our visits.,0,valid
"The coliseum is obviously a marvel of ancient humanity and culture. It is magnificent when viewed in context, and is something that bowled me away. My friend and I didn’t book in advance, which might have been slightly more annoying if we went during the summer season, but for March it was perfectly fine, with the wait only taking us ~1 hour.  We also got discounted entry for being under 25 EU citizens, costing us €4 for standard entry, which was an added bonus!",1,valid
Well it is little bit different than what one sees in films and pics. Little bit disappointed about the maintenance. Sad such a good craftsmanship not preserved as it has to.,0,valid
"So much going on in the square. Lots of people and tours gather here. It was great to sit and listen to the audio tour describing the area, it was well worth the price. Visit the clock tower, the view is amazing!",0,valid
"Soo crowded and angry!! People are soo angry for us! Why?? I hate here, i dont learn here history, i dont trip here!",0,valid
This was one of the best experiences I have ever had in my whole life. Being on the 124th and 125th floors made me feel like I’m on the top of the world.  I will make sure to go up there again when I come back to Dubai!,1,valid
It’s a must do when in Rome. We have visited before but found it quicker to enter due to COVID. Rather than book a tour like we did in 2019 we paid less than €5 each making this experience even better value for money.,1,valid
"This iconic square should be on everyone’s must see list in Venice. We visited midweek and although there were plenty of others around, it was much less crowded than at the weekend. The square has a number of bars and cafes around it and there is an orchestra that plays at the outside tables of one of the restaurants which really adds to the atmosphere. Warning - these cafes and bars are much more expensive due to their location so only sit down at one of them if you are prepared to spend a significant amount of money (€13.50 on a small black coffee not including service charge   )",1,valid
We got the boat from Lucerne to go up Mount Rigi.  The scenery was lovely and we were fortunate to have cloudless clear blue skies.  Warm weather for february meant we could sit out on deck albeit with gloves on!  I would recommend this trip.,0,valid
"It was a fun place to explore, see period buildings, mixed with modern life.  I am sure it is much like many other Old sections of cities around the world.",0,valid
"It's the Colosseum, not sure what else I need to say? If you've never been, it will meet or exceed your expectations in terms of scale and putting 'ancient' Rome into perspective.",0,valid
You have to visit The Great Wall in order to really experience the beauty and the Marvel of such human engineering feat. Mind blown!,1,valid
1st time to miami south beach love the atmosphere will go again. Stood 4 blocks away from the beach loved the walking distance everyday,0,valid
Such a beautiful & unique place to visit even for a little wonder!!! However at times of Covid-19 it is still well worth a visit!!! Less tourists  than usual and a chance to take perfect snaps!!! Highly recommended indeed!!!,0,valid
When you are on top floor the winds make you deal of heaven. The view is outstanding & fountain below mesmerized everything,0,valid
"Luzern or Lucerne is a small city around 55 km from Zurich on the banks of lake luzern. Accessible by road as well as train from every major place in Switzerland, it presents a highly picturesque location. Swiss Alps, lake, pleasant weather, comfortable hotels, one can’t ask for more... It’s the base town for Mount Pilatus, one of the most famous locations in Switzerland. Just 30 km ahead, there is Angelberg, the base town for Mount Titlis, another of the great locations in Switzerland. Lake luzern offers a great view of the Lucerne town as well as the nearby hills, snowclad lovely mountains etc... The Cruise on lake luzern is fantastic, one will be spellbound for nearly 2 hours on board, just trying to grab the beautiful sites on offer by eyes... It’s complete with an audio guide explaining the locations in English also. If in a group, just chill n enjoy with dining n wining.... A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE....",0,valid
"We enjoyed our time wandering this beautiful area. The architecture is stunning especially in December when we went, the streets are decorated for Christmas and it's so amazing! Truly a Christmas village!",0,valid
Must see in Venice. Great place ... if there are not too many tourists. Very close to Palazzo Ducale and only a 7 min walk to Rialto Bridge. Dont miss it!,0,valid
"There are not much to say about Colosseum. Everybody knows it and you have to visit it when you are in Rome. The best thngs i can share about it are my tips. So read carefully: 1) There is one ticket for Colosseum - Roman Forum - Palatine Hill, so 2) Buy your ticket from the Palatine Hill Entrance and after this go to Colosseum. There is almost never long queue there and you skip the line of buying ticket at Colosseum. 3) Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are in the same (main) place. I mean that there is no boredrs between them. So, avoid the huge queue fo Roman Forum entrance (everybody goes there after Colosseum) and start from the Palatine Hill. Small or no queue there.  Thank me later.",1,valid
The best way to experience this old town is jumping on a cyclo ride around. It is so funny to explore and witness to your eyes the daily lives of local people in this crowded quarter.,1,valid
Lots of great history at this outdoor museum. We didn't have a lot of time but we walked the whole length of the fortress to the King's gate. Stop in the first building to get an idea of what to see if you don't have more than a couple of hours. Its a nice place to get a quick history on Finland.,0,valid
"We had heard so many good things but unfortunately we where left disappointed. We paid for skip the queues 124,124 & 148 tour. The lady giving the tour basically ran us straight to the top leaving half the group behind skimming over any information that people at the back wouldn’t hear. Once on 148 we where given teas/coffees but the people who worked up there didn’t speak good English and where not knowledgable in any questions we asked, then asked us to tip him!!!! We decided to go down to the other levels to see what was different and if we could find more information and facts about the building. 124&125 where busy but a lot more viewpoints. When the sun started to set we decided to go back up when the lady at the lift said we couldn’t go back up!!! No one had mentioned this to us and explained how disappointed we where so she let us back up. All in all I wouldn’t recommend. Great for views but that’s it, don’t waste your money in my opinion!",1,valid
"So much happening it this tightly packed area. Traffic is hectic and noisy, even so there are quieter corners and if you look carefully you can see the structure of the place behind the superficial brash commercialism.",0,valid
What can I say but WOW it was even more incredible than I imagined. Our private tour guide  Tony from Wendy Wu was excellent gave us a personal 5 star trip of all Beijing’s Highlights including the Forbidden City Summer Palace Temple of Heaven and Tiananmen Square we absolutely loved it,0,valid
"I went on vacation to Rome in Italy and believe it when they say the Roman Colosseum is a wonder because it really will take your breath away learning its history and how it was built, not by slaves, but by professional engineers of that time period.  It is a remarkable site being old Rome to new modern Rome together.  Do not pass up this attraction.",0,valid
We were on the boat tour after the cog train ride up Mr. Pilatus. The lake is charming and the views of the surrounding mountains and town are incredible.,0,valid
"The quintessential sight to see on any visit to Rome just has to be the Roman Colosseum. This great structure, standing for so many centuries, is as big a draw today for the Citizens of the modern World, as it was for the Roman Citizens of the Ancient World more than 2,000 years ago!  My Wife and I were quite fortunate on our last trip to Rome last summer to have had our hotel lodgings within walking distance of the Colloseum. We were able to stroll over and gaze on the mighty, awe-inspiring structure without the inconveniences of traffic, parking, or limited viewing time from a moving vehicle (unable to stop and pause in the traffic). On foot we could take our time, gazing as long as we wanted, waiting as long as necessary for people to move out of the way for the ""perfect"" photo, etc. If you go to Rome, you must see the Collosseum.",0,valid
Took the chair lift up and the luge down - worth it!  The Great Wall is an amazing experience!  The beauty of the Wall and the surrounding area takes your breath away!  Loved every minute of our time here!,1,valid
"We stayed in Hanoi for 5 days and visited the Old Quarter a number of times.  We found some amazing little cafes and places to eat.  The Night Markets are highly recommended.Be wary of pickpockets operating in pairs on scooters....as soon as someone shoves a map at your chest, their hands are underneath trying to grab wallets / phones.  We saw it happen twice in 2 days.",1,valid
You feel like you’re in either Venice or Amsterdam with all the canals running thru this area. Well worth a few hours strolling thru the streets and admiring the beauty.,0,valid
The island was a great place to visit and walk around. The buildings and their history was very interesting and my 7yo daughter had a lot of fun looking for the elfs around the island. We came across a pink hpus where was a little cafe..What a great little cafe to drop I to for a coffee and hot chocolate. It's warm and cozy and coffee was served with a smile on a cold windy day.  Thank you,1,valid
Place is filled with trashy people.  People smoking pot and cursing in front of the best hotels.  Shooting and fights are commonplace.  Gangs run the area.  Stay inside at night.,0,valid
Very very touristy but very old and photogenic. A variety of coloured timber buildings used as restaurants and shops. Picturesque area including a river lock and swing bridge. Bring your camera!,1,valid
We booked a tour thru Viator. It was great. The Colosseum is such a natural wonder. Our tour included special access to the underground and to the top. What a view! Cant miss this.,0,valid
"I found this island fortress remarkable! Pick a good day to walk around the fortress. Filled with cannons and look out points. The sea fortress is located right on the Baltic Sea, I would advise you dress accordingly!",0,valid
"We sailed the lake from Flueelen to Lucerne, about 2 1/2 hrs.  The weather was good and we enjoyed taking several photos of the villages, lake boat traffic and shoreline mountainside scenes.  We also enjoyed a glass of wine which was very relaxing.  This is not a trip for action Jackson types who have difficulty chilling.    However, the boat system does allow for frequent opportunities to hop on and off if you do get bored.",0,valid
"Today, this enchanting place is one of our all time favorites. The history of the area is very different from today. It was a very poor part of town. Residents in past ignored it. But today it reveals the unique architectural history of the area. The old wooden buildings will give you a good idea of how people lived in the Middle Ages. Enjoy.",1,valid
Much nicer than Saigon. Pleasant and full of character. You have to try Pho when there. And walk round the lake,0,valid
Beautiful by night.. We nipped down to take some photos and have a stroll. It is as beautiful by night as it is during the day!!,0,valid
"it´s  exelent, the biggest building has stunning views, burj khalifa was build between 2004 and 2010, it has 840 meters of high, and i woud recomend it to any person who is loking for a great human achiev",0,valid

"Getting very dangerous! I have been living in South Florida for 15 years and over the last year South Beach has become very unsafe. This past weekend my car was broken in to with a hammer just to steal my handicap sticker in the middle of the day. There is a huge amount of homelessness, drug use, and petty crime and city leaders just don’t seem to care. Be very careful if visiting and do not park on the street if you don’t want to risk having your car vandalized! I recommend visiting Sunny Isles, Bal Harbour, or Hollywood over Miami Beach to anyone coming to  South Florida. Not a good place for people traveling with children either.",1,valid
"It is not a museum actually it's only part of the curvh/mosque that is open, the grand hall. Beautiful structure and amazing to see but the ticket for only that is overly priced I think since there's nothing to see except the grand hall and some ruins in the entrance area. Ticket is 105 turkish lira.",1,valid
We came to the Piazza at San Marco a few times during our visit to Venice.  It was lovely to hear the musicians playing.  I wish there was more seating available.  It seems like the only seating is for a few restaurants.  It would be nice to have some other chairs or benches available for those who just need to get off their feet for a few minutes.,1,valid
The lake is beautiful. Walked from Lion Monument to Other side. Then took a great morning hike along hr lake up to Richard Wagner's villa. Just beautiful,0,valid
Even during the floods it was a pleasure to visit. The place is like going back in time. With many people put off due to the high tides the Square was relatively quiet and we had time to admire the magnificence and splendour of the place. Simply enchanting.  We didn’t purchase anything directly in the Square but the surrounding area was good value for money. Can’t wait to return.,0,valid
"Finally ticked this off from our bucket list! Our timing is not that good...crowded everywhere. Be prepared to queue to get tickets, shuttle and cable car.  Several options to conquer the wall, cable car to the highest post was our choice :-)  This is a historical site and must visit. Another amazing architecture and project management! The best way to end the hike...sumptuous peking duck! Shout out to John (Zhang) - Here is Beijing our warm and hospitable local guide. Thank you for imparting with us the story and the significance of the Great Wall.",1,valid
"The constructions on the island are testimonies to the intriguing history of Finland, Sweden & Russia. We had a guided tour and learnt a great deal about the history, community and landscape of everything. Great day out from Helsinki!",1,valid
You must see the Architectural ingenuity is phenomenal. And when you walk into the main hall you can feel the peace and  tranquillity of this  historical place.,0,valid
"I visited Simatai and Badaling Great Walls, but Mutianyu is my top choice. It is the longest fully-restored Great Wall section open to tourists, with 23 watchtowers. It is also much less crowded than Badaling, has better architecture than Simatai.  The most convenient way is to head to Dongzhimen Wai bus station and take the 0830hr bus direct to Mutianyu Great Wall entrance. Bus fare is 30rmb, about 1.5 hours ride. At the ticketing office, I paid 45 rmb for the entrance ticket, 15rmb for return shuttle bus ticket & 100rmb for cable car up one way. If you wish to save money, you can purchase the cable car return trip 120rmb, but it means you have to start and end at the cable car station.  After the entrance, I took the shuttle bus to the main section, then walked past some souvenirs shops and restaurants, then took the cable car up to No. 14 watchtower. On top, one can walk eastward to No. 1 watchtower or westward to No.23 watchtower. If you head west, it is much steeper and you need to u-turn when you arrive at No.23 watchtower. Majority of visitors, including me, headed east to No. 6 watchtower, which is generally downhill. It was a pleasant hike, with nice surrounding scenery. I took about 2 hours hiking from No. 14 to No. 6 watchtower, with many stops for photo shoots and short rests. At No. 6 watchtower, I took the toboggan one way down 100rmb. It was fun sliding down the track, highly recommended.",1,valid
We had a private car take us from Beijing to the wall (only ¥125 per person) so that we could spend as long at the wall as we wished. I definitely recommend this because it means you aren’t restricted by your times as the car waits for you to finish at your own pace. We spent five hours there. Highly recommend the open cable car and toboggan as it is an unforgettable experience. Definitely arrive at the wall early to miss most of the crowds. The ticket for entrance cable car and toboggan was only ¥180.,1,valid
"The workers at this mosque were downright rude. They questioned my daughter's age and had no respect for her as a young girl. Even when she was crying begging them to believe her age they did not budge. Simply because she looks older did not give them a reason to charge her an adult fee when she clearly fits the children fee. The mosque however is beautiful, one of the most amazing I have seen. The architecture is incredible and truly embodies the Turkish look. If the service were to be improved, this place could be incredible.",0,valid
"Great area to wander round, plenty of bars and restaurants. The buildings in the area are beautiful and the waterways, locks and bridges add to the charm of the place.",1,valid
"Fabulous to be able to see such history and beautiful buildings, definitely the place to visit during your stay.",0,valid
I will always be coming back! I absolutely adore The Great Wall! Mutianyu passage is spectacular! Recommended!,0,valid

Great place and must go. Incredible exhibition and history ! The reconstruction and effort to maintain it is really appreciated so we can see this great portion of the Roman history,0,valid
"Hanoi's Old Quarter is full of life.  There's lots to see and most of all lot's of street food, but you have to be cautious as there are vendors who set up shop everywhere and we bought BBQ pork skewers that were mostly fat (hardly any meat).  Unfortunately, we had to dump it.  But there are soup places that are great, just look where the crowds are.  Also, the lake is nearby and it is pleasant to walk around that area, particularly in the evening.  We found it safe.  Also, there are many money exchange counters, do comparison shopping to check the rates.",1,valid
"I have been to South Beach a half dozen trips for various reasons and enjoy it presents an opportunity for a nice, long, unobstructed walk while being close to plenty of restaurants and shops.  Don't expect serene ocean sounds in the evenings, rather it is that mixed with music from nearby establishments and cars along Ocean Drive.",1,valid
One of the architectural wonders of the world.  It's worth the trip to Istanbul just to see this.  It's amazing even before you stop and consider that it's 1500 years old,0,valid

We had a pleasant trip here but the amount of touts & illegal sellers pestering you with there wares was a real pain in the backside. It’s the same everywhere. So I would recommend purchasing you tickets from the genuine website & don’t get conned in the streets.,0,valid
This place was so beautiful and with the moving bridge and the German style homes it’s almost like a postcard. Definitely a great stroll during your stay!,0,valid
The water in this lake is crystal clear as it is in all the lakes and rivers we have seen in Switzerland. The whole country seems to have undergone a spring cleaning.,0,valid
"Hope on the ferry from Helsinki and you will be on the island in 10minutes. There is so much exploring to be done, and some lovely little coffee shops to call in and have a bite to eat (Cafe Silo is my recommendation) The ferries run every 20minutes or so and cost 5 euros, you can stay as long as you like explore. A great day out.",0,valid
"South beach offers beautiful, soft, sandy beaches with a long paved beach walk parallel to the ocean for walking, running, biking and skating.",0,valid
You can only get there by ferry. There are museums & galleries and a nice walk around the island with good views. Plenty of Cafes to choose from,0,valid
It was my first time in Istanbul and this place was truly beyond beautiful. Really enjoyed our visit here.,0,valid
There is a wide variety of shops and a lot of old buildings with beautiful architecture. Night markets are mostly food markets so don’t go there to shop!,0,valid
"The attraction needs a solid hour inside to see. The central area is massive and you will want to take some time admiring the lights, pillars, alter, windows and dome in general. There are interesting smaller naves to each side which are worth walking past. Look closely at the marble panels that have been cut thinly and placed on the wall to mirror each other.  The upper level is reached by a great cobblestone ramp to the left of the main entrance, just inside the door. It criss crosses back and forth several times taking you to the top. It is wide enough for an old carriage! It is not so crowded up there, as many people don't see the ramp!!! Once upstairs the view down onto the main floor is amazing, and the lights are so close you may touch them. Walk around the whole area for the best photos. The stairs down are at the back.",1,valid
"Its good for cheap shopping as well as there are boutique shops with some good clothes,, shoes and purses. Very lively to walk around and lot of restaurants as well closeby.",1,valid
"Pre-book highly recommended.  One of the places which immediately springs to mind when Italy is mentioned is, of course, the Colosseum.  Blue sky and sunshine surrounded us as we approached the venue on the open top tourist bus.  Nice museum inside and interesting information panels dotted around.",1,valid
The view from the top of Burj khalifa was really unexplained. The high skyscrapers look very small from the top. Highly recommended!,0,valid
"This area is a must see for first-timers in Venice. During the day it is crowded with people going to St. Mark's and the Doge's Palace and other sites in the area. All of these are great things to do. The place is much less crowded in the evening although it is still an area filled with tourists. Although I spent time here on my first trip to Venice, I think for return visitors there are many other places in the city that are much more appealing.",0,valid
"Great place to chill, and enjoy the day. The sand it very white , and clean, the water blue and clear. It’s a lovely beach, and very close to all the shops and restaurants if you should need anything.",1,valid
A well preserved village area.Amazing old shops dating back to the 14th century.Beautiful architecture with the  river canals running through them.,0,valid
While in Swiss people do visit this lake luzern! Lake Lucerne is a lake in the central Switzerland. It is one of the most popular tourist stop as this lake offers the greatest scenic variety in the country. A steamer cruise in this lake is a wonderful experience but the evening one is the best as you can see the towards the sea lights it’s the town! It is once in a lifetime experience to have a romantic dinner on the cruise facing the beauty of Swiss!,1,valid
The location is bit far off - and of course there are lot of tourists - but the closeness to ming tombs makes up for it - and the views are great.,0,valid
I visited it right when the official change took place.  It is different. The images of living creatures were carefully covered up to adhere to Muslim rules.  It is a magnificent and historically important site.  Needless to say the conversion has caused some controversy.  I was just happy to visit and appreciate the history and importance of the venue.  I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Istanbul.,0,valid

"From the Helsinki market place there is a ferry HSL which is only a short ride of 20 minuts to the sea fortress Suomenlinna. We did go there on a sunny august day and we did have a great day. It is really a historic sea fortress, build in 1748 by Sweden and later used by Russia and wen Finland became independent they used it as well in 1973 the military left the island and it is since runned by the ministry of education and culture. 1991 it became a Unesco world heritage site. You can have a walk, visit museums, shop og dine on the island. of course there are many of the old buildings which do tell stories. Today there are more than 1.000.000 visitors a year and there are 800 residents. You need to bring plenty of time, there is so much to do on this historic place, many fantastic views and we will recommend it to every one visiting Helsinki.",1,valid
"Even though there were people there at sunrise, there were certainly a lot less than later in the day. This is an advantage of staying on the island. Even though we were in the Cannaregio district, it was always an interesting and different walk to Piazza San Marco and nearby sights such as the Bridge of Sighs.",1,valid
