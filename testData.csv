Worth a walk through to see how the locals live under a communist/socialized regime. The oppression and restricted life was palpable. The people were always mindful of what they were saying and shared clearly party line stories.
"The Suomenlini fort is a small island out the coast of Helsinki about 20 minutes by ferry. It's only 5 euro for the boat, no need to take an expensive tour. We took the first boat and had a nice walk around the island. When we were there it was quite cold but still it's a nice place to visit when in Helsinki. The history of Suomenlini is also the history of Finland. Must see."
"A windy day at Suomenlinna. Kids loved the ferry ride to the Island and enjoyed the ruins of the fortress. We found our path just little off the blue route to Kustaanmiekka, the farthest point of the island, even with our travel buggy. The fortress' caves were an adventure with our 2- & 5-year-olds. On our way back to mainland we stopped by the K-market to grab ice cream and waited for the ferry to come.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The effects of the covid are obvious, since there are so few people visiting in the heart of the season."
"The Old Quarter is definitely the classic side of Hanoi. It’s a beautiful area and feels safe. We went on food tour with Hanoi Street Food tour (hanoistreetfoodtour) which we really enjoyed. She took us to 7 different places and we tried lots of different things. We also did a walking tour using Withlocals. We chose “The True Essence of Hanoi: Highlights & Hidden Gems” with Sung, who was an excellent guide. We took a taxi to the HCM mausoleum and then walked to a temple on West Lake on our own and also went to Temple of Literature. Enjoyed a drink at a sky bar at night and another in a restaurant on the lake"
"Beautiful architecture of an ancient part of town where different industries use to have their quarters, tanneries, ice making, mills, etc. Cobblestone streets with timbered old houses and churches. Also you can see the boats passing through the locks and also the swing bridge."
"Island fortress. Few miles away from main land. Frequent Boat services available. Need a full day to walk all around the island. Old fortress and monuments, gardens, beautiful scenery. Families with young children will enjoy much.  good for day family picnic."
"Its a must do if your are visiting Dubai, but they over charge for photos taken by a professional photographer at 123 floor. We paid $60 per person, very expensive."
"really enjoyed this, found it more interesting than the blue mosque. Fastinating history and beautiful mosaics."
"With it's blue, green waters; jet skis roaring; seagulls flying and screaming overhead, South Beach has to be one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I may never leave"
Great experience and a beautiful view from the top of burj khalifa. Although it can get really crowded but it's worth visiting at least once.
"This portion of the wall was relatively easy to get to (joined a small group tour by Trippest)  and not too bad to get to the wall itself. There is a short uphill climb to get to the cable car, which I used. Going to the top on foot didn't look as hard as I expected, but time is also a consideration. Once at the top you have the choice of continuing up or down the wall, but there are also up and down areas including steps all along each segment between towers. The views were amazing all along this portion. If you can make it up to the cable car, you can enjoy large portions of this wall no matter what your physical limitations are. The active people, in the tour group I was with, made it to the top tower allowable, and back, in less time than we were given, the rest did what they could or wanted to do. It really didn't matter as the views were great from the very first tower. Loved this location!"
"The locals seem to love it and eat all over the place on the street. The levels of hygiene are to say the least poor but it is a very popular place and very social. Not my idea of fun especially on a long holiday - do not want to get ill. Quite a few market stall type shops selling all the usual cotton scarves, purses etc... Worth a wander just don't eat!"
"The square is central, has lots of restaurants, cafés, museums and historical buildings to look at (basilica, palace, museo corner)"
